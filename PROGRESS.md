# FLT formalization — progress and dependency tree

Goal: `theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem` in `Fermat/Basic.lean`,
with the proof tree walked top-down; every gap is an explicit `sorry`-d theorem
(never an `axiom`), and every layer is compiled and axiom-checked
(`#print axioms` must show at most `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`,
`sorryAx`).

Strategy: treat the proof as a dependency tree. State the theorem, prove it
from the strongest available mathlib facts plus explicitly stated gaps, then
recurse into the gaps. Follow the Wiles/Taylor–Wiles route as organized by the
Frey–Serre–Ribet reduction; use Buzzard's FLT project (Imperial) blueprint as a
map where helpful.

        two explicit nodes in `Fermat/FLT/FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` (own

          curve or its quotient by the rational order-p subgroup cut out by
          the stable line) has rational points containing ℤ/2 × ℤ/2p:
          semistability + Minkowski force a trivial character (rational
          p-point on E or E/C), and full 2-torsion is rational on both
          (visible Weierstrass form resp. odd-degree rational isogeny).

          rational points ≅ ℤ/2 × ℤ/2p for p ≥ 5 (primality dropped as
          unneeded) — now PROVEN (2026-07-16) from the faithful
          classification below: images of an injective hom from the finite

          corestricts into the torsion submodule, and 4p ≥ 20 > 16 ≥ the

              character (`E[p] ∧ E[p] ≅ μ_p`).

              B6bc's, and the Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt hypothesis) now
              carries a finite exceptional set `S` of places — the

              unspecified finite set, so the `∀ q ∉ {2,3,ℓ}` form was

                — PROVEN sorry-free (2026-07-16): the contraction of the
                maximal ideal is the maximal ideal
                (`Ideal.IsMaximal.under` on the integral closure + local

                `cyclotomicCharacter_globalFrob` and its mod-ℓ corollary
                are UNCONDITIONALLY PROVEN ([propext, Classical.choice,
                Quot.sound]); the Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt chain now
                rests on the single leaf `exists_frobenius_conj_mem_coset`; (ii′) ✗
                `isUnit_natCast_adicCompletionIntegers` — PROVEN
                sorry-free (2026-07-16): a valuation-subring unit is an
                element of valuation one; the completion's valuation
                restricts to the global one, which on integers is the

                (vendored `Frobenius.lean`): a Frobenius sends m-th
                roots of unity to their q-th powers when q ∤ m — apply

            - ✓ sorry-free bridges (own work, `Chebotarev.lean`):

              lemmas.
      - Supporting sorries in vendored infrastructure
        (`Fermat/FLT/EllipticCurve/Torsion.lean`):
        - ✓ `n_torsion_finite` — DERIVED (re-derived 2026-07-16, second
          route): the torsion count `card_torsionBy` is `n² > 0`, and
          positive `Nat.card` forces finiteness. Statement specialized
          (VENDORING CHANGE) to separably closed characteristic-zero
          fields — the only fields at which the tree uses it (`galoisRep`
          gained `[CharZero K]`). The former division-polynomial route
          (`TorsionFinite.lean` with nodes
          `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`,
          covering arbitrary characteristic) is SUPERSEDED and removed —
          the frontier shrinks by two nodes.
        - ✓ `n_torsion_card` (= n² over sep. closed fields, `(n : k) ≠ 0`)
          — now DERIVED (2026-07-16, `TorsionCard.lean`, own work):
          `card_torsionBy` PROVEN by strong induction peeling off the
          minimal prime factor — multiplication by `p := n.minFac`
          restricts to a surjection `E[n] → E[n/p]` with kernel `E[p]`,
          so Lagrange + the first isomorphism theorem give
          `#E[n] = p²·(n/p)²`; no CRT needed. Faithful leaves:
          - ✗ `TorsionCard.smul_surjective` — divisibility of the points
            group: `[n]` is surjective on points over a separably closed
            field for `(n : k) ≠ 0` (separable isogeny).
          - ✗ `TorsionCard.prime_torsion_card` — `#E[p] = p²` for prime
            `p` with `(p : k) ≠ 0` (kernel of the separable degree-`p²`
            isogeny).
        - ✓ `WeierstrassCurve.galoisRep` — CONSTRUCTED (2026-07-16). The
          formerly sorry-d DATA is now the genuine representation: the
          Galois action on points (`Point.map`, via the `DistribMulAction`
          instance) restricted to the `n`-torsion and made `ZMod n`-linear
          (`AddMonoidHom.toZModLinearMap`). Continuity: the coordinates of
          the (finitely many, via `n_torsion_finite`) torsion points
          generate a finite extension `F/K`; the rep kills the open
          subgroup `Gal(Kᵃˡᵍ/F)` (`fixingSubgroup_isOpen`), so every fiber
          is a union of open cosets — continuous into any topology on the
          target. `#print axioms`: sorryAx enters only through
          `n_torsion_finite`. Mazur/B4 are now statements about the REAL
          representation.
        - ✓ `group_theory_lemma` — PROVEN (2026-07-16) in
          `Fermat/FLT/EllipticCurve/TorsionCounting.lean` (own work, not
          vendored): structure theorem for finite abelian groups + torsion
          counting in `ZMod m` (`#torsionBy d (ZMod m) = gcd d m`, via the
          first isomorphism theorem) + multiset determination (each prime
          `q ∣ n` occurs exactly `r` times, each exponent forced to
          `v_q(n)`) + CRT reassembly (`ZMod.equivPi`). Axioms:
          `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — sorry-free.
        - ✓ `Module.Finite (ZMod n) (nTorsion n)` instance — statement was
          FALSE for `n = 0`; now requires `[NeZero n]` (marked VENDORING
          CHANGE) and is derived from `n_torsion_finite`, consolidating the
          sorry into that single node.
        - ✓ `galoisRepresentation` DistribMulAction fields (earlier layer).
      - `Fermat/FLT/GaloisRepresentation/HardlyRamified/Frey.lean`: 1 sorry
        (`torsion_isHardlyRamified` — the Frey curve's rep is hardly
        ramified, Serre §4.1 + Tate curve theory; the former second sorry,
        the rank hypothesis, was discharged by `p_torsion_rank`).

## Next-step reconnaissance (2026-07-16, session 3 close)

- `torsion_isUnramified` / `torsion_isTameAtTwo` / `torsion_isFlat` /
  `exists_weilPairing`: the natural source is the FLT repo's
  `FLT/KnownIn1980s/EllipticCurves/` directory (TateCurve.lean 512
  lines, plus WeilPairing.lean, Torsion.lean, GoodReduction.lean,
  Flat.lean, TateParameter.lean, TateCurveBaseChange.lean,
  ReductionBaseChange.lean, TateCurveConstruction.lean) — exactly the
  remaining Frey-condition vocabulary. **BLOCKER WITHDRAWN
  (2026-07-16, later the same day): the earlier check was faulty —
  `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction` and
  `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LocalField.Basic` BOTH exist at our pinned rev
  (a3364faec429), and the FLT repo pins the SAME rev. No pin bump is
  needed.** The vendoring closure (verified): the KnownIn1980s
  EllipticCurves files plus the FLT-repo Mathlib-additions
  `FLT.Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction`,
  `FLT.Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.ValuativeRel.Basic`,
  `FLT.Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.ValuativeRel.ValuativeTopology`,
  `FLT.Slop.NumberTheory.TsumDivisorsAntidiagonal`, and their recursive
  imports — a multi-file vendoring workstream, now fully unblocked at
  the current pin. NB `tateEquiv` (Tate's uniformization)
  is **sorry-d DATA** (a `def`), so vendoring must track it as
  meaning-poisoning until its existence node closes (cf. the old
  `galoisRep` situation).
- `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` (glue): the eventual proof needs an
  embedding `E →+* ℚ̄₃` (DONE 2026-07-16:
  `nonempty_ringHom_to_padicAlgClosure`, proven sorry-free in
  `Lift.lean` via `IsAlgClosed.lift`), charpoly-vs-baseChange and conj (DONE 2026-07-16:
  `charpoly_baseChange_conj`, proven sorry-free in `Lift.lean` — the
  family-membership equation transports charpolys along
  `algebraMap A B`), trace/det-to-coefficients for
  2-dim (DONE 2026-07-16: `charpoly_eq_quadratic_of_finrank_two` +
  generic quadratic coefficient lemmas, proven sorry-free in
  `Chebotarev.lean`), and a 3-adic Frobenius value for the cyclotomic
  character
  (consider stating a single ℤ_p-adic Frobenius-value node
  `cyclotomicCharacter` at `globalFrob q` = `q`, from which
  `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob` follows via
  `cyclotomicCharacter.toZModPow` — bridging `PadicInt.toZMod` with
  `toZModPow 1` needs a small proven lemma).
- `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq` (Brauer–Nesbitt): an elementary
  route avoiding semisimplification: Cayley–Hamilton gives
  `(ρg − 1)(ρg − χg) = 0`; on `H := ker χ̄` every element is unipotent
  (`(ρh − 1)² = 0`), so a 2-dim Kolchin argument yields an `H`-fixed
  line; its Galois orbit analysis (H normal) plus, in the ρ|H-trivial
  case, simultaneous triangularization of a commuting split family,
  produces an invariant line. Both ingredients are candidate stated
  nodes if the direct proof stalls.

## Policy: no citation-terminal nodes (Deyao, 2026-07-16)

The FLT project's `knownin1980s` mechanism (an axiom proving any proposition
"an expert could deduce from pre-1990 literature") is **banned** here — first
vendored as a sorry-backed theorem, then removed altogether. No node of the
tree may be closed by appeal to expert knowledge or the literature; a node is
closed only when Lean compiles its proof. The full tree, including Mazur,
Ribet, Wiles–Taylor–Wiles and all supporting theory, is to be brought into
Lean and checked mechanically. This increases the scope enormously and that
is an explicit, accepted choice: the point is that the trust boundary is the
Lean kernel plus the (shrinking) list of `sorry`s — never a human assertion.

## Vendored material

`Fermat/FreyPackage.lean` and `Fermat/FreyCurve.lean` are adapted from the
FLT project (https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT, Apache 2.0,
Buzzard–Van de Velde–Monticone), with module-system syntax removed and small
cast/tactic fixes for mathlib v4.32.0-rc1. Their assumption mechanism
(`knownin1980s` etc.) is always replaced by explicit `sorry`-rooted theorems
here, so `#print axioms` remains the single source of truth for what is
assumed. Axiom invariant: every declaration must use at most
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, sorryAx]`.

## Log

- 2026-07-16: project scaffolded in `fermat/`; branch `flt-formalization`,
  worktree `/tmp/flt-worktree`. Layer 1 (reduction to odd primes ≥ 5) built.
- 2026-07-16: layer 2 — FreyPackage normalization + Frey curve with Δ, c₄, j
  computations, all sorry-free; sorry root moved to `FreyPackage.false`.
- 2026-07-16: layer 3 — vendored the FLT project's 32-module closure under
  `Fermat/FLT/` (import-rewritten; `knownin1980s` axiom → sorry-backed
  theorem; one auto-generated instance name fixed). mathlib re-pinned to the
  FLT project's exact rev a3364faec429. `FreyPackage.false` proven from
  `mazur` + B4; sorry frontier now: B4, knownin1980s (Mazur), Torsion
  infrastructure (6), HardlyRamified/Frey (2). FLT repo cloned to
  ~/Documents/cs/FLT for reference (never build there).
  NB: the main checkout at ~/Documents/cs/dissertation was hit by an iCloud
  eviction incident (see chat log); pushes go through the rescue clone in the
  session scratchpad until the main .git re-materializes.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2): `group_theory_lemma` PROVEN sorry-free in new file
  `Fermat/FLT/EllipticCurve/TorsionCounting.lean` (~350 lines: torsionBy
  transfer equivs, torsion of Pi, `#torsionBy d (ZMod m) = gcd d m`,
  structure-theorem + counting + CRT assembly). `Module.Finite (ZMod n)`
  instance in Torsion.lean fixed (`[NeZero n]`, was false for n = 0) and
  derived from `n_torsion_finite`. Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier now:
  Mazur, B4, `torsion_isHardlyRamified` (2 in HardlyRamified/Frey.lean),
  `n_torsion_finite`, `n_torsion_card`, `galoisRep` (data).
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): `WeierstrassCurve.galoisRep` CONSTRUCTED —
  the sorry-d data node is closed; the Galois action on `n`-torsion is the
  real one, continuity via finite-extension stabilizers (open fixing
  subgroups, Krull topology). sorryAx now enters `galoisRep` only through
  `n_torsion_finite`. Sorry frontier: Mazur, B4, 2× HardlyRamified/Frey,
  `n_torsion_finite`, `n_torsion_card` — 6 sorries total, all Props.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): B4 decomposed — `torsion_not_isIrreducible`
  now proven from `torsion_isHardlyRamified` + new node **B5**
  (`HardlyRamified/Reducible.lean`). Sorry frontier (5, all Props):
  `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B5, `n_torsion_finite`,
  `n_torsion_card`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): `n_torsion_finite` decomposed and derived —
  new file `TorsionFinite.lean` (own work) proves finiteness from two
  polynomial sorry nodes (`eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`,

  `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B5, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): **B5 decomposed and derived** — new file
  `HardlyRamified/Lift.lean` (own work) states B6a (ℓ-adic lift, bundled
  `HardlyRamifiedLift` structure), B6bc (residual Frobenius charpolys are
  those of `1 ⊕ χ̄`; to be split into faithful B6b/B6c), and the
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt node; B5 proven from them. Sorry frontier
  (8, all Props): `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B6a, B6bc,
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3): **`mazur` decomposed and derived** — new file
  `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` (own work) states Serre's §4.1
  reducible-case analysis (`exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`:
  reducibility yields an elliptic curve over ℚ with rational points ⊇
  ℤ/2 × ℤ/2p) and Mazur's torsion theorem in weak form
  (`mazur_torsion_bound`: no such curve exists for prime p ≥ 5);
  `FreyPackage.mazur` proven from them by contradiction. Axiom audit clean.
  Tree legend gains □ (not yet started) for planned-but-unstated deeper
  nodes (Vélu quotients, Mazur's full fifteen-group classification).
  Sorry frontier (9, all Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_torsion_bound`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B6a, B6bc,
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **`mazur_torsion_bound` PROVEN** from the
  new faithful sorry node `WeierstrassCurve.mazur_classification` (Mazur's
  fifteen-group torsion theorem, stated on `Submodule.torsion ℤ E(ℚ)`),
  closing the □ for the classification. Proof: torsion corestriction of an
  injective hom + `Nat.card` comparison against each of the fifteen groups
  (`Nat.card_zmod`, `Nat.card_prod`, omega). The unused primality
  hypothesis was dropped from `mazur_torsion_bound` (only `5 ≤ p` is
  needed). Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (9, all Props):

  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **`torsion_isHardlyRamified` decomposed
  and derived** — new file `HardlyRamified/FreyConditions.lean` (own work)
  states the four defining conditions of `IsHardlyRamified` for the Frey
  curve as separate nodes (`torsion_det` — Weil pairing;
  `torsion_isUnramified` — Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich + Tate curve;
  `torsion_isFlat` — finite flat group scheme at p; `torsion_isTameAtTwo`
  — Tate curve at 2), and `Frey.lean` assembles them by the structure
  constructor. **Sorry gate installed** (`Fermat/SorryGate.lean`, root
  `Fermat.lean`): `lake build` now FAILS with `SORRY GATE FAILED` while
  `fermat_last_theorem` depends on `sorryAx` (and enforces the axiom
  invariant); a gate failure is the expected outcome during development —
  the continue-signal for the loop. Scratch audits import `Fermat.Basic` +
  leaf modules, never root `Fermat`. Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier
  (11, all Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,

  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd` (12 with
  both division-polynomial nodes counted).
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **B6bc split and derived** — vendored the
  FLT project's newer compatible-family layer
  (`Deformations/RepresentationTheory/GaloisRepFamily.lean`, defs,
  sorry-free; `HardlyRamified/Family.lean` = B6b `mem_isCompatible`, with
  the conclusion extracted into the named predicate
  `IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily` as a marked VENDORING CHANGE;
  `HardlyRamified/Threeadic.lean` = B6c `three_adic`). New own-work glue
  node `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` in `Lift.lean` (compatibility
  bookkeeping; consumes B6c in its eventual proof); `residual_charFrob_eq`
  (B6bc) now PROVEN from B6b + glue. `HardlyRamifiedLift` gained an
  `IsModuleTopology ℤ_[ℓ] O` field (B6a statement strengthening, needed by
  B6b's instance context). Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (14, all
  Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_classification`, `torsion_det`, `torsion_isUnramified`,
  `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`, B6a, B6b,

  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt decomposition
  STARTED** (○ in progress) — new own-work file
  `GaloisRepresentation/Chebotarev.lean`: `globalFrob v : Γ K` defined
  (image of the local arithmetic Frobenius under `Γ Kᵥ → Γ K`; proven
  `charFrob v = charpoly at globalFrob v` by `rfl`), and the topological
  Chebotarev density node stated (✗ `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`: the
  conjugacy classes of `globalFrob` outside any finite `S` are dense).
  Remaining pieces of this decomposition (Brauer–Nesbitt for 2-dim mod-ℓ,
  the mod-ℓ cyclotomic character as a continuous character via mathlib's
  `modularCyclotomicCharacter`, its value `q` at `globalFrob q`, and the
  re-derivation of `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq`) are the next
  layer. **Loop mechanics finalized**: the 30-min cron is REPLACED by a
  `Stop` hook (`.claude/check-sorries.py`, registered in
  `.claude/settings.json`): every attempt by Claude to end its turn is
  vetoed (exit 2) while proof-position sorries remain or `lake build`
  fails the gate; verified live by driving a scratch Claude Code instance
  through tmux (it answered, was blocked with the node list, resumed loop
  work). Sorry frontier (15, all Props): the 14 above +
  `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **mod-ℓ cyclotomic character CONSTRUCTED,
  sorry-free** (`Chebotarev.lean`): `cyclotomicCharacterModL ℓ : Γ ℚ →*
  (ZMod ℓ)ˣ` (mathlib's `modularCyclotomicCharacter` precomposed with
  `Γ ℚ → (ℚ̄ ≃+* ℚ̄)`), PROVEN trivial on the fixing subgroup of ℚ(μ_ℓ)
  (`cyclotomicCharacterModL_eq_one`) and PROVEN continuous into the
  discrete `ZMod ℓ` (`continuous_cyclotomicCharacterModL`, Krull-open
  kernel + coset covering). Two new faithful sorry nodes stated:
  ✗ `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob` (χ̄(Frob_q) = q for q ≠ ℓ) and
  ✗ `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq` (Brauer–Nesbitt, 2-dim mod-ℓ
  instance: charpolys everywhere equal to those of 1 ⊕ χ̄ ⇒ not
  irreducible). Chebotarev.lean added to the root import graph.
  Module-system gotcha recorded: in `module` files, some legacy mathlib
  instances (e.g. `AlgebraicClosure.isAlgebraic`) only synthesize under
  `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in`. Axiom audit
  clean. Sorry frontier (17, all Props): the 15 above +
  `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob`, `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq`.
  Next: derive `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq` (the parent) from
  density + Brauer–Nesbitt + Frobenius value + continuity (needs
  discreteness of the module topology on `End` over `ZMod ℓ` and the
  place ↔ prime-number bridge for `Ω ℚ`).
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt node
  DERIVED** — `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq` is now PROVEN in
  `Lift.lean` from the three faithful nodes (density, BN, Frobenius
  value of χ̄) plus new sorry-free bridge lemmas in `Chebotarev.lean`:
  `discreteTopology_moduleTopology` (a finite module over a discrete
  ring has discrete module topology, via `exists_fin'` + coinduced),
  `exists_prime_toHeightOneSpectrum` (PID argument: every finite place
  of ℚ is generated by a prime number), `monic_quadratic_ext` and the
  comparison-quadratic coefficient lemmas. Proof shape: an auxiliary
  prime q₀ ∉ {2,3,ℓ} pins finrank = 2; the coefficient-agreement set
  with `1 ⊕ χ̄` is closed (coefficient maps continuous into discrete
  `ZMod ℓ`, End discrete) and contains the dense Frobenius conjugates
  (charpoly conjugation-invariance via `LinearEquiv.charpoly_conj`;
  χ̄ conjugation-invariance since `(ZMod ℓ)ˣ` is abelian); monic
  quadratics are determined by two coefficients; Brauer–Nesbitt closes.
  Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (16, all Props):

  `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq`, `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob`,

  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4): **Tate-curve/reduction batch vendored, ZERO
  new sorries** — nine files from the FLT repo (import-rewritten), all
  fully proven: `TateCurveConstruction.lean` (1551 lines, the Tate
  curve `E_q` with its q-expansions), `TateCurveBaseChange.lean`,
  `ReductionBaseChange.lean` (multiplicative-reduction transfer +
  Kraus–Laska minimality; the upstream copy is sorry-free, so the
  planned opt-out was dropped), the mathlib overlay
  `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`,
  `Slop/NumberTheory/TsumDivisorsAntidiagonal.lean`, and four
  `FLT.Mathlib` prerequisites discovered during the build
  (QuadraticDiscriminant, Splits, Weierstrass DVR overlay,
  IsDiscreteValuationRing). All wired into the root module; full
  `lake build` fails only at the sorry gate. Frontier unchanged at 17:
  `smul_surjective`, `prime_torsion_card`, `exists_weilPairing`,
  `exists_frobenius_conj_mem_coset`, B6a, B6b, B6c, `mod_three`,
  `mazur_classification`, `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `torsion_isUnramified`, `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`,
  `torsion_unramified_of_good_reduction`,
  `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`, `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`,
  `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`. Next: reformulate `TateCurve.lean`'s sorry-d data
  (`tateCurveEquiv`) existentially, then decompose `torsion_isTameAtTwo`
  against the now-complete Tate-curve infrastructure.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **QuadraticTwists closure vendored,
  ZERO new sorries** — nineteen files, all fully proven:
  `QuadraticTwists/QuadraticTwists.lean` (793 lines, quadratic twists
  of Weierstrass curves + Galois descent of points) and
  `QuadraticTwists/SplitMultiplicativeReduction.lean` (486 lines: every
  curve with multiplicative reduction has a quadratic twist with SPLIT
  multiplicative reduction — the twist step of the tame-at-2 argument),
  plus seventeen `FLT.Mathlib` prerequisites (EllipticCurve
  Aut/Affine.Point/GaloisDescent/VariableChange overlays, quadratic
  norms, unramified local rings, DVR AdjoinRoot/Separable, Galois
  basics, Gauss lemma, etc.). Wired into the root module; full
  `lake build` fails only at the sorry gate. Frontier unchanged at 17.
  The remaining Tate-curve gap is exactly upstream `TateCurve.lean`
  (512 lines, 12 sorries incl. sorry-d DATA `tateCurveEquiv`/
  `tateEquiv`/`tateEquivSepClosure`) — next: existential
  reformulation, as done for the Weil pairing.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **TateCurve.lean vendored with the
  sorry-d data reformulated existentially** — the fully proven upstream
  material (Tate curve series `tateA₄`/`tateA₆`/`tateCurve` with their
  `evalInt` identities, the valuation lemmas `valuation_Δ_lt_one`,
  `valuation_c₄_eq_one`, `valuation_j_eq`, `one_lt_valuation_j`, the
  Tate parameter `q`/`qUnit` with `q_ne_zero`/`valuation_q_lt_one`,
  base-change functoriality `tateCurve_baseChange`,
  `tateParameter_map`, `q_baseChange`, and the reduction-preserving
  instances) is vendored verbatim. The upstream sorry-d DATA
  (`tateCurveEquiv`, `tateEquiv`, `tateEquivSepClosure`, `tatePoint`)
  and its satellite lemmas are replaced by TWO honest Prop nodes:
  ✗ `exists_variableChange_tateCurve` (Tate's theorem ATAEC V.5.3:
  `E ≅ E_{q(E)}` by a variable change) and
  ✗ `exists_tateEquivSepClosure` (a Galois-equivariant group iso
  `Ωˣ/qᶻ ≅ E(Ω)` over a separable closure — an existential Prop, since
  the iso is canonical only up to sign). The upstream import of the
  sorry-d WeilPairing data file is dropped; `weilPairing_tatePoint`
  (sign coherence between the two packages) is NOT vendored — if a
  consumer appears it must be stated as a joint existential. Frontier:
  19 (17 + the 2 new Tate nodes). Next: decompose
  `torsion_isTameAtTwo` against `exists_tateEquivSepClosure` +
  `exists_quadraticTwist_hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` DERIVED from
  `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`** — mathlib's
  `Polynomial.exists_mul_add_mul_eq_C_resultant` (the resultant lies in
  the ideal generated by the two polynomials, via the adjugate of the
  Sylvester map) with the degree bounds `natDegree_Φ_le` /
  `natDegree_ΨSq_le` gives `Φ n * p + ΨSq n * q = C (resultant)`; the
  resultant node evaluates this to `±Δ^k`, a unit when `Δ` is, and
  scaling the Bézout identity by its inverse closes `IsCoprime`.
  Frontier: 18.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`torsion_isUnramified` DECOMPOSED
  by reduction type** — the node is now DERIVED from two new faithful
  nodes via the case split on `q ∣ abc`:
  ✗ `torsion_isUnramified_of_good` (good reduction at `q ∤ abc`, to be
  closed against the vendored NOS node) and
  ✗ `torsion_isUnramified_of_multiplicative` (`q ∣ abc`: multiplicative
  reduction, `p ∣ v_q(j)`, quadratic twist to split reduction, Tate
  uniformization). Each new node isolates one mechanism; the vendored
  infrastructure for both (GoodReduction.lean;
  SplitMultiplicativeReduction.lean + TateCurve.lean) is in place.
  Frontier: 19.
