# FLT formalization — progress and dependency tree

Goal: `theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem` in `Fermat/Basic.lean`,
with the proof tree walked top-down; every gap is an explicit `sorry`-d theorem
(never an `axiom`), and every layer is compiled and axiom-checked
(`#print axioms` must show at most `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`,
`sorryAx`).

Strategy: treat the proof as a dependency tree. State the theorem, prove it
from the strongest available mathlib facts plus explicitly stated gaps, then
recurse into the gaps. Follow the Wiles/Taylor–Wiles route as organized by the
Frey–Serre–Ribet reduction; use Buzzard's FLT project (Imperial) blueprint as a
map where helpful.

## Tree (✓ = proven here or in mathlib, ✗ = sorry, ○ = in progress)

- `fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem`
  - ✓ `FermatLastTheorem.of_odd_primes` (mathlib, NumberTheory/FLT/Four.lean)
  - ✓ `fermatLastTheoremFour` (mathlib)
  - ✓ `fermatLastTheoremThree` (mathlib)
  - ✓ `fermatLastTheoremFor_of_five_le : ∀ p, p.Prime → 5 ≤ p → FermatLastTheoremFor p`
    (`Fermat/PrimeFive.lean`) — proven from:
    - ✓ `FreyPackage` + `FreyPackage.of_not_FermatLastTheoremFor_p_ge_5` +
      `FreyPackage.fermatLastTheoremFor_p_ge_5` (`Fermat/FreyPackage.lean`,
      adapted from the FLT project, Apache 2.0) — a counterexample for prime
      `p ≥ 5` normalizes to a Frey package (coprime, `a ≡ 3 mod 4`, `b` even).
      Fully proven, no sorry.
    - ✓ `FreyPackage.freyCurve : WeierstrassCurve ℚ` with `IsElliptic`
      instance, `Δ`, `b₂`, `b₄`, `c₄`, `j`, and
      `FreyCurve.j_valuation_of_bad_prime` (`Fermat/FreyCurve.lean`, adapted
      from the FLT project). Fully proven, no sorry.
    - ✓ `FreyPackage.false : FreyPackage → False` — now PROVEN from Mazur +
      B4 (mirroring the FLT project's `Proof.lean` boss-theorem spine):
      - ✗ `FreyPackage.mazur` (`Fermat/FLT/FreyCurve/Mazur.lean`) — the mod-p
        rep of the Frey curve is irreducible; proof = `knownin1980s`, which we
        vendored as a sorry-backed theorem (NOT their `axiom`), file
        `Fermat/FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.lean`.
      - ✗ `FreyPackage.galoisRep_not_irreducible` (B4, `Fermat/PrimeFive.lean`)
        — Wiles modularity + Ribet level lowering + no weight-2 level-2 cusp
        forms. This is also the current frontier of the FLT project itself
        (their B5/B6, hardly-ramified route, not yet stated in Lean there).
      - Supporting sorries in vendored infrastructure
        (`Fermat/FLT/EllipticCurve/Torsion.lean`):
        `n_torsion_finite`, `n_torsion_card`, `group_theory_lemma`,
        `Module.Finite` instance, `galoisRepresentation` DistribMulAction
        fields ("should all be easy" per FLT project), and — nota bene —
        `WeierstrassCurve.galoisRep` itself, which is **sorry-d DATA** (the
        continuous Galois representation on p-torsion); the FLT project has
        it sorry-d too. Statements about sorry-d data are about an
        unspecified representation; this must eventually be filled with the
        real construction for B4/Mazur to mean what they should.
      - `Fermat/FLT/GaloisRepresentation/HardlyRamified/Frey.lean`: 2 sorries
        (the Frey curve's rep is hardly ramified — Serre §4.1).

## Vendored material

`Fermat/FreyPackage.lean` and `Fermat/FreyCurve.lean` are adapted from the
FLT project (https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT, Apache 2.0,
Buzzard–Van de Velde–Monticone), with module-system syntax removed and small
cast/tactic fixes for mathlib v4.32.0-rc1. Their assumption mechanism
(`knownin1980s` etc.) is always replaced by explicit `sorry`-rooted theorems
here, so `#print axioms` remains the single source of truth for what is
assumed. Axiom invariant: every declaration must use at most
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, sorryAx]`.

## Log

- 2026-07-16: project scaffolded in `fermat/`; branch `flt-formalization`,
  worktree `/tmp/flt-worktree`. Layer 1 (reduction to odd primes ≥ 5) built.
- 2026-07-16: layer 2 — FreyPackage normalization + Frey curve with Δ, c₄, j
  computations, all sorry-free; sorry root moved to `FreyPackage.false`.
- 2026-07-16: layer 3 — vendored the FLT project's 32-module closure under
  `Fermat/FLT/` (import-rewritten; `knownin1980s` axiom → sorry-backed
  theorem; one auto-generated instance name fixed). mathlib re-pinned to the
  FLT project's exact rev a3364faec429. `FreyPackage.false` proven from
  `mazur` + B4; sorry frontier now: B4, knownin1980s (Mazur), Torsion
  infrastructure (6), HardlyRamified/Frey (2). FLT repo cloned to
  ~/Documents/cs/FLT for reference (never build there).
  NB: the main checkout at ~/Documents/cs/dissertation was hit by an iCloud
  eviction incident (see chat log); pushes go through the rescue clone in the
  session scratchpad until the main .git re-materializes.
