# FLT formalization — progress and dependency tree

Goal: `theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem` in `Fermat/Basic.lean`,
with the proof tree walked top-down; every gap is an explicit `sorry`-d theorem
(never an `axiom`), and every layer is compiled and axiom-checked
(`#print axioms` must show at most `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`,
`sorryAx`).

Strategy: treat the proof as a dependency tree. State the theorem, prove it
from the strongest available mathlib facts plus explicitly stated gaps, then
recurse into the gaps. Follow the Wiles/Taylor–Wiles route as organized by the
Frey–Serre–Ribet reduction; use Buzzard's FLT project (Imperial) blueprint as a
map where helpful.

## Tree (two symbols per item — first: ✓ = proven here or in mathlib, ✗ = sorry; second: · = normal, ○ = in progress right now)

Every item carries exactly two leading symbols. `✗·` open sorry node;
`✗○` sorry node actively being worked on in the current block of work;
`✓·` proven; `✓○` proven but being reworked (rare — e.g. a statement
change forces revisiting a finished proof). Update the `○` marks at
the START and END of each block of work.

- **`minkowski_character_trivial` — the mathlib route is VERIFIED to
  exist at our pin** (all names checked in
  `Mathlib/NumberTheory/NumberField/ExistsRamified.lean` and
  `Discriminant/Different.lean`):
  `NumberField.finrank_eq_one_of_unramified` ([Algebra.Unramified ℤ 𝒪]
  ⟹ finrank ℚ K = 1), `NumberField.exists_not_isUnramifiedIn`,
  `NumberField.exists_not_isUnramifiedAt_int_of_isGalois` (Galois case:
  some prime has ALL primes above it ramified — the right form for the
  abelian fixed field), `NumberField.not_dvd_discr_iff_isUnramifiedIn`,
  `NumberField.abs_discr_gt_two`. What remains is the **dictionary**:
  (1) `K := IntermediateField.fixedField H` is finite over ℚ (VERIFIED
  in mathlib: `instance [IsGalois k K] : CompactSpace Gal(K/k)`
  in `FieldTheory/Galois/Profinite.lean` gives compactness of `Γ ℚ`,
  and `Subgroup.quotient_finite_of_isOpen` in
  `Topology/Algebra/OpenSubgroup.lean` gives finite index of the open
  subgroup; the correspondence is in MATHLIB proper
  (`Mathlib/FieldTheory/Galois/Infinite.lean`):
  `InfiniteGalois.fixingSubgroup_fixedField (H : ClosedSubgroup _)
  [IsGalois k K] : fixingSubgroup (fixedField H) = H` — exactly the
  recovery direction needed (`H` open ⟹ closed; `fixedField H = ⊥` ⟹
  `H = fixingSubgroup ⊥ = ⊤` via `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_bot`)
  — and `IsGalois ℚ ℚ̄` synthesizes via the priority-100 instance
  `IsAlgClosure.isGalois` (`Galois/Basic.lean:594`)), giving
  `NumberField K`;
  (2) `localInertiaGroup q ≤ ker (χ ∘ res_q)` for all `q` transfers to
  `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt ℤ P` for every prime `P` of `𝓞 K` — the
  local-global inertia dictionary (same flavor as the NOS glue node
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasGoodReduction`; whichever is built first should
  factor out the common bridge). The dictionary's two endpoints are now
  precisely identified: `localInertiaGroup v` is mathlib's GENERIC
  `AddSubgroup.inertia` (`Algebra/Group/Subgroup/Basic.lean:1123`,
  membership DEFINITIONAL: `σ ∈ I.inertia G ↔ ∀ x, σ • x - x ∈ I`)
  applied to `(𝔪 (IntegralClosure 𝒪ᵥ Kᵥᵃˡᵍ)).toAddSubgroup` acting via
  `Γ Kᵥ`; the NOS node speaks `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup`
  (`RingTheory/Valuation/RamificationGroup.lean:50`) of valuation
  subrings of `kˢᵉᵖ`; the classical side is `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt` ↔
  `Ideal.ramificationIdx = 1` (`Ideal.ramificationIdx_eq_one_iff`, used
  in `ExistsRamified.lean`). The dictionary = compatibility of the two
  inertia presentations along the embedding `ℚ̄ ↪ ℚ̄_q` + the
  inertia-trivial ⟹ unramified direction for the finite quotient.
  **Step (1) is now PROVEN in-tree**: `finite_quotient_of_isOpen`
  (`MazurTorsion.lean`, unconditional) — an open subgroup of `Γ ℚ` has
  finite quotient; the full instance chain (`IsAlgClosure.isGalois` →
  `CompactSpace Gal` → `Subgroup.quotient_finite_of_isOpen`)
  synthesizes without intervention. MOREOVER mathlib has the COMPLETE
  group↔field transfer (`FieldTheory/Galois/Infinite.lean`):
  `InfiniteGalois.isOpen_iff_finite` (`IsOpen L.fixingSubgroup ↔
  FiniteDimensional k L`), `InfiniteGalois.normal_iff_isGalois`, and
  the combined `isOpen_and_normal_iff_finite_and_isGalois` — so for
  `H` open normal, `L := fixedField H` has `fixingSubgroup L = H`
  (correspondence, `H` closed) and is a FINITE GALOIS extension of ℚ
  by these named lemmas, giving `NumberField L` and activating
  `exists_not_isUnramifiedAt_int_of_isGalois` directly. Every step of
  the Minkowski node except the inertia dictionary is now named
  mathlib API. Assembly facts (scratch-COMPILED 2026-07-16):
  `IntermediateField.fixedField (E := AlgebraicClosure ℚ) H`
  typechecks for `H : Subgroup (Γ ℚ)` (the parameter is named `E`, not
  `K`), and `IsGalois ℚ ℚ̄` + `CompactSpace (Γ ℚ)` BOTH synthesize —
  but ONLY under `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency
  false` (the known module-system gotcha; without it `IsGalois`
  synthesis fails). Remaining derivation names also verified:
  `Subgroup.isClosed_of_isOpen` (`OpenSubgroup.lean:273`, for feeding
  the `ClosedSubgroup` correspondence) and
  `IntermediateField.finrank_eq_one_iff : finrank F K = 1 ↔ K = ⊥`
  (`Adjoin/Basic.lean:275`, for extracting `1 < finrank` from
  `H ≠ ⊤`). Exact correspondence forms:
  `InfiniteGalois.fixingSubgroup_fixedField (H : ClosedSubgroup
  Gal(K/k)) [IsGalois k K] : (fixedField H).fixingSubgroup = H.1`
  (apply at `⟨H, Subgroup.isClosed_of_isOpen H hopen⟩`) and
  `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_bot : fixingSubgroup ⊥ = ⊤`
  (@[simp], `Galois/Basic.lean:258`) for the nontriviality step. The
  derivation is mechanically specified, every name compilation- or
  grep-verified; write it as [dictionary node, sorry] + [assembly,
  proven] in one sitting. The dictionary node should be stated with
  the `{𝒪 : Type*} [IsIntegralClosure 𝒪 ℤ L]` parametrization of
  `ExistsRamified.lean` (avoids constructing `NumberField L` inside
  the statement; provide `haveI : NumberField L := ⟨⟩` in the
  assembly). The prime-above-`p` existence step:
  `Ideal.exists_ideal_over_prime_of_isIntegral_of_isDomain
  [Algebra.IsIntegral ℤ 𝒪] (P) [IsPrime P] (hker : ker ≤ P) :
  ∃ Q, IsPrime Q ∧ Q.comap (algebraMap ℤ 𝒪) = P`
  (`RingTheory/Ideal/GoingUp.lean:280`) at `P := span {(p : ℤ)}`;
  `(p : 𝒪) ∈ Q` follows from the comap equation; the integrality and
  injectivity instances come from the `IsIntegralClosure` invocations
  used verbatim in `ExistsRamified.lean` (`isIntegral_algebra`,
  `algebraMap_injective`). NOTHING in the assembly plan remains
  unverified. **EXECUTED (2026-07-16, same session): the assembly

  `ℚ̄ ↪ ℚ̄_q` intertwines the restricted action with the original, so
  a σ in the local inertia (trivial mod `𝔪` on the integral closure
  upstairs) transports its congruence to the embedded `𝓞 L`, giving
  trivial residue action at the induced prime. Target shape:
  `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt R q` is an ABBREV for
  `FormallyUnramified R (Localization.AtPrime q)`
  (`Unramified/Locus.lean:45`), with the concrete characterization
  `Algebra.isUnramifiedAt_iff_map_eq` (`Unramified/LocalRing.lean:134`,
  the file whose FLT overlay is ALREADY VENDORED): unramified at `q`
  over `p` ⟺ `κ(q)/κ(p)` separable (automatic here — finite fields)
  ∧ `pS_q = qS_q`. So the dictionary reduces to the ideal equality
  `q·(𝓞 L)_Q = Q·(𝓞 L)_Q`, i.e. `e = 1`, from the trivial inertia
  action — the classical argument. Hypothesis-exact bridging form:
  `Ideal.ramificationIdx_eq_one_iff [q.IsPrime]
  [Algebra.EssFiniteType R S] [Algebra.IsIntegral R S]
  [PerfectField (q.under R).ResidueField] :
  q.ramificationIdx R = 1 ↔ Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt R q`
  (`RamificationInertia/Ramification.lean:105`) — for `R = ℤ` the
  residue field of `q.under ℤ` is `𝔽_p` (perfect ✓), so the dictionary
  may equivalently prove `ramificationIdx = 1`, the purely
  ideal-theoretic form. Its instance chain is complete:
  `EssFiniteType.of_finiteType` is an INSTANCE
  (`EssentialFiniteness.lean:95`), fed by `FiniteType.of_finite` from
  the module-finiteness of rings of integers, and `PerfectField` of
  finite fields is instance-automatic. SCRATCH-COMPILED (2026-07-16):
  `Ideal.ramificationIdx_eq_one_iff.mp` elaborates at `ℤ → 𝓞 L` given
  only `haveI := IsIntegralClosure.isIntegral_algebra ℤ (A := 𝓞 L) L`
  and the transparency option — so the dictionary node may be proven
  by establishing `Q.ramificationIdx ℤ = 1` from the inertia
  hypothesis, with the conversion to `IsUnramifiedAt` a one-liner.
  For the `e = 1` step itself, mathlib's
  `NumberTheory/RamificationInertia/HilbertTheory.lean` provides the
  group side: `inertia G P` (the `MulSemiringAction` inertia subgroup
  for ideals under group actions, with
  `IsInertiaField.of_isGaloisGroup` and the `rank_left`/`rank_right`
  theorems tying its fixed field's degrees to `e` and `f`) — a THIRD
  inertia presentation, and the SHORTEST route — no field bookkeeping
  needed: **`card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn p : Nat.card (inertia
  Gal(L/K) P) = p.ramificationIdxIn B`** (used inside `rank_left`)
  gives `e` DIRECTLY as the inertia group's cardinality (exact form:
  `Ideal.card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn` at `Galois.lean:317`,
  hypotheses `[IsDomain R] [IsDomain S] [Module.Finite R S] [Flat R S]
  [P.LiesOver p] [p.IsPrime] [P.IsPrime] [PerfectField p.ResidueField]`
  — for `ℤ → 𝓞 L` the only nonobvious one is `Flat ℤ (𝓞 L)`, which
  holds since torsion-free over a PID; note the inertia here is
  `P.inertia G` — `Ideal.inertia`, a FOURTH spelling, for a
  `MulSemiringAction` of `G = Gal(L/ℚ)` via `IsGaloisGroup`); trivial
  inertia ⟹ card 1 ⟹ `ramificationIdxIn = 1`, then (SCRATCH-COMPILED
  2026-07-16: `Ideal.card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn (G := (L ≃ₐ[ℚ]
  L)) (Ideal.span {p}) Q` elaborates at `ℤ → 𝓞 L` — the `Flat` and
  `MulSemiringAction` instances synthesize automatically given the
  standing `isIntegral_algebra` haveI and the transparency option —
  CAVEAT: that scratch took `[PerfectField (span {p}).ResidueField]`
  as a HYPOTHESIS; the derived proof must supply it via
  `PerfectField.ofFinite` + finiteness of `(span {q} : Ideal
  ℤ).ResidueField` ≅ 𝔽_q — BRIDGE FOUND
  (`LocalRing/ResidueField/Ideal.lean:110`):
  `instance : IsFractionRing (R ⧸ I) I.ResidueField`; for maximal
  `I = span {q}` the quotient `ℤ ⧸ I` is already a (finite) field, so
  the fraction-ring algebraMap is bijective and `Finite I.ResidueField`
  transfers along the resulting equiv (finiteness of `ℤ ⧸ span {q}`
  from `Int.instFiniteQuotientSpan`-style instances or
  `Ring.HasFiniteQuotients.finiteQuotient` with `span {q} ≠ ⊥`).
  SCRATCH-COMPILED (2026-07-16), full fragment: `Prime (q:ℤ)` →
  `span_singleton_prime` → `isMaximal_of_ne_bot` →
  `Ring.HasFiniteQuotients.finiteQuotient` →
  `IsFractionRing.surjective_iff_isField.mpr
  ((Ideal.Quotient.maximal_ideal_iff_isField_quotient _).mp hmax)` →
  `Finite.of_surjective` → `PerfectField` by `inferInstance`. (Do NOT
  introduce `haveI : Field (ℤ⧸I)` — it creates an instance diamond
  against the quotient's CommRing path; go through `IsField` instead.) Also confirmed: `Ideal.liesOver_span_iff (hP : P ≠ ⊤)
  (hp : Prime p) : P.LiesOver (span {p}) ↔ algebraMap R S p ∈ P`
  (`KrullDimension/Basic.lean:202`) supplies the `LiesOver` instance
  from the membership hypothesis)
  `ramificationIdxIn_eq_ramificationIdx` (the lemma ExistsRamified.lean
  itself uses) lands at the specific prime and
  `ramificationIdx_eq_one_iff.mp` (scratch-compiled) finishes. The
  dictionary then only needs the transport:
  `localInertiaGroup`-image-fixes-`L` ⟹ `inertia Gal(L/ℚ) Q` trivial
  (via `lift_map` and surjectivity of restriction to `L`).
  Post-derivation audit:
  `open_normal_subgroup_eq_top_of_inertia_le`,
  `minkowski_character_trivial`, and
  `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible` all show exactly
  `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — correctly
  rooted through the dictionary, no foreign axioms.**;
  (3) conclude `ker χ = ⊤` from `fixedField χ.ker = ⊥` by the infinite
  Galois correspondence, hence `χ = 1`. Estimated: one focused session;
  start from a FRESH context.

## Previous reconnaissance (2026-07-16, session 3 close)

- `torsion_isUnramified` / `torsion_isTameAtTwo` / `torsion_isFlat` /
  `exists_weilPairing`: the natural source is the FLT repo's
  `FLT/KnownIn1980s/EllipticCurves/` directory (TateCurve.lean 512
  lines, plus WeilPairing.lean, Torsion.lean, GoodReduction.lean,
  Flat.lean, TateParameter.lean, TateCurveBaseChange.lean,
  ReductionBaseChange.lean, TateCurveConstruction.lean) — exactly the
  remaining Frey-condition vocabulary. **BLOCKER WITHDRAWN
  (2026-07-16, later the same day): the earlier check was faulty —
  `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction` and
  `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LocalField.Basic` BOTH exist at our pinned rev
  (a3364faec429), and the FLT repo pins the SAME rev. No pin bump is
  needed.** The vendoring closure (verified): the KnownIn1980s
  EllipticCurves files plus the FLT-repo Mathlib-additions
  `FLT.Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Reduction`,
  `FLT.Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.ValuativeRel.Basic`,
  `FLT.Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.ValuativeRel.ValuativeTopology`,
  `FLT.Slop.NumberTheory.TsumDivisorsAntidiagonal`, and their recursive
  imports — a multi-file vendoring workstream, now fully unblocked at
  the current pin. NB `tateEquiv` (Tate's uniformization)
  is **sorry-d DATA** (a `def`), so vendoring must track it as
  meaning-poisoning until its existence node closes (cf. the old
  `galoisRep` situation).
- `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` (glue): the eventual proof needs an
  embedding `E →+* ℚ̄₃` (DONE 2026-07-16:
  `nonempty_ringHom_to_padicAlgClosure`, proven sorry-free in
  `Lift.lean` via `IsAlgClosed.lift`), charpoly-vs-baseChange and conj (DONE 2026-07-16:
  `charpoly_baseChange_conj`, proven sorry-free in `Lift.lean` — the
  family-membership equation transports charpolys along
  `algebraMap A B`), trace/det-to-coefficients for
  2-dim (DONE 2026-07-16: `charpoly_eq_quadratic_of_finrank_two` +
  generic quadratic coefficient lemmas, proven sorry-free in
  `Chebotarev.lean`), and a 3-adic Frobenius value for the cyclotomic
  character
  (consider stating a single ℤ_p-adic Frobenius-value node
  `cyclotomicCharacter` at `globalFrob q` = `q`, from which
  `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob` follows via
  `cyclotomicCharacter.toZModPow` — bridging `PadicInt.toZMod` with
  `toZModPow 1` needs a small proven lemma).
- `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq` (Brauer–Nesbitt): an elementary
  route avoiding semisimplification: Cayley–Hamilton gives
  `(ρg − 1)(ρg − χg) = 0`; on `H := ker χ̄` every element is unipotent
  (`(ρh − 1)² = 0`), so a 2-dim Kolchin argument yields an `H`-fixed
  line; its Galois orbit analysis (H normal) plus, in the ρ|H-trivial
  case, simultaneous triangularization of a commuting split family,
  produces an invariant line. Both ingredients are candidate stated
  nodes if the direct proof stalls.

## Policy: no citation-terminal nodes (Deyao, 2026-07-16)

The FLT project's `knownin1980s` mechanism (an axiom proving any proposition
"an expert could deduce from pre-1990 literature") is **banned** here — first
vendored as a sorry-backed theorem, then removed altogether. No node of the
tree may be closed by appeal to expert knowledge or the literature; a node is
closed only when Lean compiles its proof. The full tree, including Mazur,
Ribet, Wiles–Taylor–Wiles and all supporting theory, is to be brought into
Lean and checked mechanically. This increases the scope enormously and that
is an explicit, accepted choice: the point is that the trust boundary is the
Lean kernel plus the (shrinking) list of `sorry`s — never a human assertion.

## Vendored material

`Fermat/FreyPackage.lean` and `Fermat/FreyCurve.lean` are adapted from the
FLT project (https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT, Apache 2.0,
Buzzard–Van de Velde–Monticone), with module-system syntax removed and small
cast/tactic fixes for mathlib v4.32.0-rc1. Their assumption mechanism
(`knownin1980s` etc.) is always replaced by explicit `sorry`-rooted theorems
here, so `#print axioms` remains the single source of truth for what is
assumed. Axiom invariant: every declaration must use at most
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, sorryAx]`.

## Log

- 2026-07-16: project scaffolded in `fermat/`; branch `flt-formalization`,
  worktree `/tmp/flt-worktree`. Layer 1 (reduction to odd primes ≥ 5) built.
- 2026-07-16: layer 2 — FreyPackage normalization + Frey curve with Δ, c₄, j
  computations, all sorry-free; sorry root moved to `FreyPackage.false`.
- 2026-07-16: layer 3 — vendored the FLT project's 32-module closure under
  `Fermat/FLT/` (import-rewritten; `knownin1980s` axiom → sorry-backed
  theorem; one auto-generated instance name fixed). mathlib re-pinned to the
  FLT project's exact rev a3364faec429. `FreyPackage.false` proven from
  `mazur` + B4; sorry frontier now: B4, knownin1980s (Mazur), Torsion
  infrastructure (6), HardlyRamified/Frey (2). FLT repo cloned to
  ~/Documents/cs/FLT for reference (never build there).
  NB: the main checkout at ~/Documents/cs/dissertation was hit by an iCloud
  eviction incident (see chat log); pushes go through the rescue clone in the
  session scratchpad until the main .git re-materializes.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2): `group_theory_lemma` PROVEN sorry-free in new file
  `Fermat/FLT/EllipticCurve/TorsionCounting.lean` (~350 lines: torsionBy
  transfer equivs, torsion of Pi, `#torsionBy d (ZMod m) = gcd d m`,
  structure-theorem + counting + CRT assembly). `Module.Finite (ZMod n)`
  instance in Torsion.lean fixed (`[NeZero n]`, was false for n = 0) and
  derived from `n_torsion_finite`. Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier now:
  Mazur, B4, `torsion_isHardlyRamified` (2 in HardlyRamified/Frey.lean),
  `n_torsion_finite`, `n_torsion_card`, `galoisRep` (data).
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): `WeierstrassCurve.galoisRep` CONSTRUCTED —
  the sorry-d data node is closed; the Galois action on `n`-torsion is the
  real one, continuity via finite-extension stabilizers (open fixing
  subgroups, Krull topology). sorryAx now enters `galoisRep` only through
  `n_torsion_finite`. Sorry frontier: Mazur, B4, 2× HardlyRamified/Frey,
  `n_torsion_finite`, `n_torsion_card` — 6 sorries total, all Props.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): B4 decomposed — `torsion_not_isIrreducible`
  now proven from `torsion_isHardlyRamified` + new node **B5**
  (`HardlyRamified/Reducible.lean`). Sorry frontier (5, all Props):
  `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B5, `n_torsion_finite`,
  `n_torsion_card`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): `n_torsion_finite` decomposed and derived —
  new file `TorsionFinite.lean` (own work) proves finiteness from two
  polynomial sorry nodes (`eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`,
  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`). Sorry frontier (6, all Props):
  `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B5, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 2, cont.): **B5 decomposed and derived** — new file
  `HardlyRamified/Lift.lean` (own work) states B6a (ℓ-adic lift, bundled
  `HardlyRamifiedLift` structure), B6bc (residual Frobenius charpolys are
  those of `1 ⊕ χ̄`; to be split into faithful B6b/B6c), and the
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt node; B5 proven from them. Sorry frontier
  (8, all Props): `mazur`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B6a, B6bc,
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3): **`mazur` decomposed and derived** — new file
  `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` (own work) states Serre's §4.1
  reducible-case analysis (`exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`:
  reducibility yields an elliptic curve over ℚ with rational points ⊇
  ℤ/2 × ℤ/2p) and Mazur's torsion theorem in weak form
  (`mazur_torsion_bound`: no such curve exists for prime p ≥ 5);
  `FreyPackage.mazur` proven from them by contradiction. Axiom audit clean.
  Tree legend gains □ (not yet started) for planned-but-unstated deeper
  nodes (Vélu quotients, Mazur's full fifteen-group classification).
  Sorry frontier (9, all Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_torsion_bound`, `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B6a, B6bc,
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt, `n_torsion_card`,
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **`mazur_torsion_bound` PROVEN** from the
  new faithful sorry node `WeierstrassCurve.mazur_classification` (Mazur's
  fifteen-group torsion theorem, stated on `Submodule.torsion ℤ E(ℚ)`),
  closing the □ for the classification. Proof: torsion corestriction of an
  injective hom + `Nat.card` comparison against each of the fifteen groups
  (`Nat.card_zmod`, `Nat.card_prod`, omega). The unused primality
  hypothesis was dropped from `mazur_torsion_bound` (only `5 ≤ p` is
  needed). Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (9, all Props):
  `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`, `mazur_classification`,
  `torsion_isHardlyRamified`, B6a, B6bc, Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt,
  `n_torsion_card`, `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`,
  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **`torsion_isHardlyRamified` decomposed
  and derived** — new file `HardlyRamified/FreyConditions.lean` (own work)
  states the four defining conditions of `IsHardlyRamified` for the Frey
  curve as separate nodes (`torsion_det` — Weil pairing;
  `torsion_isUnramified` — Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich + Tate curve;
  `torsion_isFlat` — finite flat group scheme at p; `torsion_isTameAtTwo`
  — Tate curve at 2), and `Frey.lean` assembles them by the structure
  constructor. **Sorry gate installed** (`Fermat/SorryGate.lean`, root
  `Fermat.lean`): `lake build` now FAILS with `SORRY GATE FAILED` while
  `fermat_last_theorem` depends on `sorryAx` (and enforces the axiom
  invariant); a gate failure is the expected outcome during development —
  the continue-signal for the loop. Scratch audits import `Fermat.Basic` +
  leaf modules, never root `Fermat`. Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier
  (11, all Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_classification`, `torsion_det`, `torsion_isUnramified`,
  `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`, B6a, B6bc,
  Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt, `n_torsion_card` +
  `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`, `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd` (12 with
  both division-polynomial nodes counted).
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **B6bc split and derived** — vendored the
  FLT project's newer compatible-family layer
  (`Deformations/RepresentationTheory/GaloisRepFamily.lean`, defs,
  sorry-free; `HardlyRamified/Family.lean` = B6b `mem_isCompatible`, with
  the conclusion extracted into the named predicate
  `IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily` as a marked VENDORING CHANGE;
  `HardlyRamified/Threeadic.lean` = B6c `three_adic`). New own-work glue
  node `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` in `Lift.lean` (compatibility
  bookkeeping; consumes B6c in its eventual proof); `residual_charFrob_eq`
  (B6bc) now PROVEN from B6b + glue. `HardlyRamifiedLift` gained an
  `IsModuleTopology ℤ_[ℓ] O` field (B6a statement strengthening, needed by
  B6b's instance context). Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (14, all
  Props): `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_classification`, `torsion_det`, `torsion_isUnramified`,
  `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`, B6a, B6b,
  `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family`, B6c, Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt,
  `n_torsion_card`, `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`,
  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt decomposition
  STARTED** (○ in progress) — new own-work file
  `GaloisRepresentation/Chebotarev.lean`: `globalFrob v : Γ K` defined
  (image of the local arithmetic Frobenius under `Γ Kᵥ → Γ K`; proven
  `charFrob v = charpoly at globalFrob v` by `rfl`), and the topological
  Chebotarev density node stated (✗ `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`: the
  conjugacy classes of `globalFrob` outside any finite `S` are dense).
  Remaining pieces of this decomposition (Brauer–Nesbitt for 2-dim mod-ℓ,
  the mod-ℓ cyclotomic character as a continuous character via mathlib's
  `modularCyclotomicCharacter`, its value `q` at `globalFrob q`, and the
  re-derivation of `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq`) are the next
  layer. **Loop mechanics finalized**: the 30-min cron is REPLACED by a
  `Stop` hook (`.claude/check-sorries.py`, registered in
  `.claude/settings.json`): every attempt by Claude to end its turn is
  vetoed (exit 2) while proof-position sorries remain or `lake build`
  fails the gate; verified live by driving a scratch Claude Code instance
  through tmux (it answered, was blocked with the node list, resumed loop
  work). Sorry frontier (15, all Props): the 14 above +
  `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **mod-ℓ cyclotomic character CONSTRUCTED,
  sorry-free** (`Chebotarev.lean`): `cyclotomicCharacterModL ℓ : Γ ℚ →*
  (ZMod ℓ)ˣ` (mathlib's `modularCyclotomicCharacter` precomposed with
  `Γ ℚ → (ℚ̄ ≃+* ℚ̄)`), PROVEN trivial on the fixing subgroup of ℚ(μ_ℓ)
  (`cyclotomicCharacterModL_eq_one`) and PROVEN continuous into the
  discrete `ZMod ℓ` (`continuous_cyclotomicCharacterModL`, Krull-open
  kernel + coset covering). Two new faithful sorry nodes stated:
  ✗ `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob` (χ̄(Frob_q) = q for q ≠ ℓ) and
  ✗ `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq` (Brauer–Nesbitt, 2-dim mod-ℓ
  instance: charpolys everywhere equal to those of 1 ⊕ χ̄ ⇒ not
  irreducible). Chebotarev.lean added to the root import graph.
  Module-system gotcha recorded: in `module` files, some legacy mathlib
  instances (e.g. `AlgebraicClosure.isAlgebraic`) only synthesize under
  `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in`. Axiom audit
  clean. Sorry frontier (17, all Props): the 15 above +
  `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob`, `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq`.
  Next: derive `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq` (the parent) from
  density + Brauer–Nesbitt + Frobenius value + continuity (needs
  discreteness of the module topology on `End` over `ZMod ℓ` and the
  place ↔ prime-number bridge for `Ω ℚ`).
- 2026-07-16 (session 3, cont.): **Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt node
  DERIVED** — `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq` is now PROVEN in
  `Lift.lean` from the three faithful nodes (density, BN, Frobenius
  value of χ̄) plus new sorry-free bridge lemmas in `Chebotarev.lean`:
  `discreteTopology_moduleTopology` (a finite module over a discrete
  ring has discrete module topology, via `exists_fin'` + coinduced),
  `exists_prime_toHeightOneSpectrum` (PID argument: every finite place
  of ℚ is generated by a prime number), `monic_quadratic_ext` and the
  comparison-quadratic coefficient lemmas. Proof shape: an auxiliary
  prime q₀ ∉ {2,3,ℓ} pins finrank = 2; the coefficient-agreement set
  with `1 ⊕ χ̄` is closed (coefficient maps continuous into discrete
  `ZMod ℓ`, End discrete) and contains the dense Frobenius conjugates
  (charpoly conjugation-invariance via `LinearEquiv.charpoly_conj`;
  χ̄ conjugation-invariance since `(ZMod ℓ)ˣ` is abelian); monic
  quadratics are determined by two coefficients; Brauer–Nesbitt closes.
  Axiom audit clean. Sorry frontier (16, all Props):
  `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `mazur_classification`, `torsion_det`, `torsion_isUnramified`,
  `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`, B6a, B6b,
  `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family`, B6c, `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`,
  `not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq`, `cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob`,
  `n_torsion_card`, `eval_ΨSq_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero`,
  `ΨSq_ne_zero_of_charDvd`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4): **Tate-curve/reduction batch vendored, ZERO
  new sorries** — nine files from the FLT repo (import-rewritten), all
  fully proven: `TateCurveConstruction.lean` (1551 lines, the Tate
  curve `E_q` with its q-expansions), `TateCurveBaseChange.lean`,
  `ReductionBaseChange.lean` (multiplicative-reduction transfer +
  Kraus–Laska minimality; the upstream copy is sorry-free, so the
  planned opt-out was dropped), the mathlib overlay
  `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`,
  `Slop/NumberTheory/TsumDivisorsAntidiagonal.lean`, and four
  `FLT.Mathlib` prerequisites discovered during the build
  (QuadraticDiscriminant, Splits, Weierstrass DVR overlay,
  IsDiscreteValuationRing). All wired into the root module; full
  `lake build` fails only at the sorry gate. Frontier unchanged at 17:
  `smul_surjective`, `prime_torsion_card`, `exists_weilPairing`,
  `exists_frobenius_conj_mem_coset`, B6a, B6b, B6c, `mod_three`,
  `mazur_classification`, `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible`,
  `torsion_isUnramified`, `torsion_isFlat`, `torsion_isTameAtTwo`,
  `torsion_unramified_of_good_reduction`,
  `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`, `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`,
  `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`. Next: reformulate `TateCurve.lean`'s sorry-d data
  (`tateCurveEquiv`) existentially, then decompose `torsion_isTameAtTwo`
  against the now-complete Tate-curve infrastructure.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **QuadraticTwists closure vendored,
  ZERO new sorries** — nineteen files, all fully proven:
  `QuadraticTwists/QuadraticTwists.lean` (793 lines, quadratic twists
  of Weierstrass curves + Galois descent of points) and
  `QuadraticTwists/SplitMultiplicativeReduction.lean` (486 lines: every
  curve with multiplicative reduction has a quadratic twist with SPLIT
  multiplicative reduction — the twist step of the tame-at-2 argument),
  plus seventeen `FLT.Mathlib` prerequisites (EllipticCurve
  Aut/Affine.Point/GaloisDescent/VariableChange overlays, quadratic
  norms, unramified local rings, DVR AdjoinRoot/Separable, Galois
  basics, Gauss lemma, etc.). Wired into the root module; full
  `lake build` fails only at the sorry gate. Frontier unchanged at 17.
  The remaining Tate-curve gap is exactly upstream `TateCurve.lean`
  (512 lines, 12 sorries incl. sorry-d DATA `tateCurveEquiv`/
  `tateEquiv`/`tateEquivSepClosure`) — next: existential
  reformulation, as done for the Weil pairing.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **TateCurve.lean vendored with the
  sorry-d data reformulated existentially** — the fully proven upstream
  material (Tate curve series `tateA₄`/`tateA₆`/`tateCurve` with their
  `evalInt` identities, the valuation lemmas `valuation_Δ_lt_one`,
  `valuation_c₄_eq_one`, `valuation_j_eq`, `one_lt_valuation_j`, the
  Tate parameter `q`/`qUnit` with `q_ne_zero`/`valuation_q_lt_one`,
  base-change functoriality `tateCurve_baseChange`,
  `tateParameter_map`, `q_baseChange`, and the reduction-preserving
  instances) is vendored verbatim. The upstream sorry-d DATA
  (`tateCurveEquiv`, `tateEquiv`, `tateEquivSepClosure`, `tatePoint`)
  and its satellite lemmas are replaced by TWO honest Prop nodes:
  ✗ `exists_variableChange_tateCurve` (Tate's theorem ATAEC V.5.3:
  `E ≅ E_{q(E)}` by a variable change) and
  ✗ `exists_tateEquivSepClosure` (a Galois-equivariant group iso
  `Ωˣ/qᶻ ≅ E(Ω)` over a separable closure — an existential Prop, since
  the iso is canonical only up to sign). The upstream import of the
  sorry-d WeilPairing data file is dropped; `weilPairing_tatePoint`
  (sign coherence between the two packages) is NOT vendored — if a
  consumer appears it must be stated as a joint existential. Frontier:
  19 (17 + the 2 new Tate nodes). Next: decompose
  `torsion_isTameAtTwo` against `exists_tateEquivSepClosure` +
  `exists_quadraticTwist_hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` DERIVED from
  `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`** — mathlib's
  `Polynomial.exists_mul_add_mul_eq_C_resultant` (the resultant lies in
  the ideal generated by the two polynomials, via the adjugate of the
  Sylvester map) with the degree bounds `natDegree_Φ_le` /
  `natDegree_ΨSq_le` gives `Φ n * p + ΨSq n * q = C (resultant)`; the
  resultant node evaluates this to `±Δ^k`, a unit when `Δ` is, and
  scaling the Bézout identity by its inverse closes `IsCoprime`.
  Frontier: 18.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`torsion_isUnramified` DECOMPOSED
  by reduction type** — the node is now DERIVED from two new faithful
  nodes via the case split on `q ∣ abc`:
  ✗ `torsion_isUnramified_of_good` (good reduction at `q ∤ abc`, to be
  closed against the vendored NOS node) and
  ✗ `torsion_isUnramified_of_multiplicative` (`q ∣ abc`: multiplicative
  reduction, `p ∣ v_q(j)`, quadratic twist to split reduction, Tate
  uniformization). Each new node isolates one mechanism; the vendored
  infrastructure for both (GoodReduction.lean;
  SplitMultiplicativeReduction.lean + TateCurve.lean) is in place.
  Frontier: 19.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`torsion_isFlat` DECOMPOSED by
  reduction type** — same pattern as `torsion_isUnramified`: DERIVED
  from ✗ `torsion_isFlat_of_good` (`p ∤ abc`: Néron-model torsion is
  finite flat, to be closed against the vendored
  `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`) and
  ✗ `torsion_isFlat_of_multiplicative` (`p ∣ abc`: `p ∣ v_p(j)` makes
  the Tate-curve extension peu ramifiée, which prolongs finite-flatly)
  via the case split on `p ∣ abc`. Frontier: 20.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`torsion_isUnramified_of_good`
  DECOMPOSED into arithmetic + glue** — new own-work file
  `FreyCurve/Semistable.lean`: the node is DERIVED from
  ✗ `freyCurve_hasGoodReduction_of_not_dvd` (the arithmetic: at odd
  `q ∤ abc` the Frey equation is `q`-integral with `q`-unit
  discriminant, so minimal with good reduction over
  `Localization.AtPrime v_q`) and
  ✗ `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasGoodReduction` (the local-global glue:
  good reduction at `q ≠ p` ⟹ `IsUnramifiedAt q`, to be closed against
  the vendored NOS node). The `ℤ_(q)`-as-DVR-with-fraction-field-ℚ
  instance package (Algebra/IsScalarTower/IsFractionRing/
  IsDiscreteValuationRing for `Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal`) is
  PROVEN as public named instances (mathlib has the lemmas but no
  instances; note `IsDedekindDomainDvr.is_dvr_at_nonzero_prime` needed
  explicit `@`-application — instance-synthesis stalls on its
  `IsDomain (𝓞 ℚ)` argument even though direct synthesis succeeds).
  Frontier: 21. Audit
  (2026-07-16): `inertia_eq_bot_of_exists_prime_over` is UNCONDITIONAL
  (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`); the chain above
  (`transport → dictionary → subgroup form`) correctly roots through
  the single surjectivity sorry only.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **UNIFICATION — the glue nodes share
  the Minkowski transport's exact shape.** `GaloisRep.ker_map` is
  `rfl`: `(ρ.map f).ker = ρ.ker.comap (absoluteGaloisGroup.map f)`.
  Hence `IsUnramifiedAt v` (`localInertiaGroup v ≤ (ρ.toLocal v).ker`)
  is equivalent, by the same `Subgroup.map_le_iff_le_comap` dance used
  in `minkowski_character_trivial`, to
  `Subgroup.map (absoluteGaloisGroup.map f) (localInertiaGroup v) ≤
  ρ.ker` — the Minkowski hypothesis `hle` with `L.fixingSubgroup`
  replaced by `ρ.ker` (whose membership = acting trivially on the
  torsion module). So the TWO `IsUnramifiedAt` glue nodes decompose as
  [content node: inertia of the appropriate local object acts
  trivially on the torsion — NOS resp. Tate] + [the SAME
  embedding-prime transport family as the surjectivity leaf]; the
  flat/tame glue nodes use the transport as an ingredient but carry
  additional content (flat prolongation resp. the quotient-character
  package). Attack the transport family ONCE, in the form serving the
  three direct consumers.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **`mod_three` DECOMPOSED** — DERIVED
  from ✗ `mod_three_reducible` (a mod-3 hardly ramified rep has a
  stable line — the Dickson/OddAbsIrred/discriminant content, with
  both classification inputs vendored PROVEN) and
  ✗ `mod_three_of_stable_line` (the quotient character of the
  resulting extension is trivial — det condition + everywhere
  unramifiedness + the already-derived Minkowski machinery; Serre
  §5.4 bookkeeping). Frontier: 22. Final interface check (2026-07-16):
  `IntermediateField.mem_fixingSubgroup_iff` exists (KrullTopology.lean
  usage) — the transport construction's source-side membership
  (`σ ∈ L.fixingSubgroup ↔ ∀ x ∈ L, σ x = x`) is available; with it,
  every interface of the shared transport is name-verified.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **surjectivity-leaf scoping** —
  mathlib at our pin has NO decomposition-group ↔ local-Galois theory
  (`decompositionSubgroup` appears only in its defining file), so the
  Neukirch II.9 route is from-scratch construction. ALTERNATE ROUTE
  (likely shorter, avoids group surjectivity entirely): to show the
  embedding prime `Q₀` has trivial inertia it suffices to show
  `e(Q₀|q) = 1` DIRECTLY (then `card (inertia) = e = 1` forces ⊥ by
  `card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn` + `Subgroup.eq_bot_of_card_eq`):
  the hypothesis "local inertia image fixes L" says exactly that `L`
  embeds into the inertia-fixed field of `ℚ̄_q`, i.e. `L ⊆ ℚ_q^{unr}`
  along the chosen embedding, and unramified local extensions have
  `e = 1` — provable through the VALUATION side (the vendored
  `IsNonarchimedeanLocalField`/`ValuativeExtension` machinery and
  mathlib's `Ideal.ramificationIdx` ↔ valuation comparison), no
  decomposition groups needed. Evaluate both routes at fresh context;
  the valuation route reuses the session's Tate-infrastructure
  instances. The
  four inertia spellings, fully mapped (2026-07-16): (1)
  `localInertiaGroup` = generic `AddSubgroup.inertia` of `𝔪` upstairs
  in `ℚ̄_q`, membership `.rfl`; (2) `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup`
  (the vendored NOS node's spelling) = kernel of the residue action of
  the DECOMPOSITION subgroup (`RamificationGroup.lean:50` — the file
  has NO theorems, so the bridge "trivial residue action ⟺ σx − x ∈ 𝔪
  ∀x ∈ A" is a short definitional unfolding to write); (3)
  HilbertTheory's subgroup inertia; (4) `Ideal.inertia`
  (MulSemiringAction), membership `.rfl`, connected to `e` by
  `card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn` and to (3) by the HilbertTheory
  file itself.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`freyCurve_hasGoodReduction_of_not_dvd`
  PROVEN** — the good-reduction arithmetic node is closed:
  `q`-integrality via the integral model (`freyCurveInt` and
  `FreyCurve.map`, each coefficient an integer, lifted through
  `map_intCast`); the discriminant `(abc)^{2p}/2⁸` is exhibited as the
  image of the explicit unit `(abc)^{2p}·(2⁸)⁻¹` of `ℤ_(q)` (both
  factors prime to `q`, inverted via `IsLocalization.AtPrime.
  isUnit_to_map_iff` and the new PROVEN bridge lemmas
  `intCast_mem_toHeightOneSpectrumRingOfIntegersRat_iff` and
  `isUnit_intCast_localizationAtPrime`), so the adic valuation of Δ is
  `1` by `mker_valuation_eq_isUnitSubmonoid`; minimality follows since
  valuation `1` is the maximum over integral models (the
  `valuation_Δ_aux` subtype bound). Frontier: 20.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **`torsion_isFlat_of_good` DERIVED** —
  the PROVEN arithmetic node applies verbatim at `q := p` (`p ≠ 2`
  since `p ≥ 5`), and a new glue node
  ✗ `isFlatAt_of_hasGoodReduction` (good reduction at `p` ⟹
  `IsFlatAt p`, to be closed against the vendored
  `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` Hopf-package node) completes the
  derivation. Frontier: 20 (one closed, one opened).
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **multiplicative arithmetic PROVEN;
  both multiplicative consumers DERIVED** —
  `freyCurve_hasMultiplicativeReduction_of_dvd` is PROVEN (integrality;
  `c₄ = c^{2p} - (ab)^p` prime to `q` by the pairwise-coprimality Xor;
  minimality by the vendored unit-`c₄` Kraus–Laska criterion
  `isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`; `v(Δ) < 1` via
  `valuation_lt_one_iff_mem` since `abc` lands in the maximal ideal).
  `torsion_isUnramified_of_multiplicative` and
  `torsion_isFlat_of_multiplicative` are DERIVED from it (+ the proven
  `j_valuation_of_bad_prime`) through two new glue nodes:
  ✗ `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (Tate glue at
  `q ≠ p`) and ✗ `isFlatAt_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction`
  (peu-ramifiée glue at `p`). All four FreyConditions reduction-type
  cases now rest exclusively on local-global glue nodes; the Frey-curve
  semistability arithmetic is complete. Frontier: 20.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Frey multiplicative reduction AT 2
  PROVEN; `torsion_isTameAtTwo` DERIVED** —
  `freyCurve_hasMultiplicativeReduction_at_two` is PROVEN (this is
  where the Frey model's defining congruences `a ≡ 3 mod 4`, `b ≡ 0
  mod 2` are consumed: they force `c` odd, so `c₄` is odd and
  `v(c₄) = 1`, while `Δ = 2^{2p-8}(ab'c)^{2p}` is in the maximal ideal
  as `2p > 8`); `torsion_isTameAtTwo` is DERIVED from it through the
  new glue node ✗ `isTameAtTwo_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (stated
  for a general elliptic curve over ℚ — the Tate/quadratic-twist glue
  at 2). ALL FOUR conditions of `IsHardlyRamified` for the Frey curve
  now rest exclusively on generic local-global glue nodes; every
  Frey-specific computation is sorry-free. Frontier: 20.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Serre's reducible-case node
  DECOMPOSED; the CRT assembly PROVEN** —
  `exists_torsion_embedding_of_not_isIrreducible` is now DERIVED from
  ✗ `exists_two_torsion_and_p_point_of_not_isIrreducible` (Serre's
  core: reducibility ⟹ some curve has full rational 2-torsion AND a
  rational point of order exactly p — the Minkowski/Vélu content) and
  ✓ `embedding_assembly` (PROVEN: injective (ℤ/2)² + element of order
  p assemble into injective ℤ/2 × ℤ/2p, via `ZMod.chineseRemainder`,
  `ZMod.lift` for the p-part, and the coprime-annihilator separation
  `p•u = u` for 2-torsion u with p odd). Frontier: 20 (one closed, one
  opened; the remaining Serre node no longer contains the group
  theory).
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Frey full rational 2-torsion PROVEN;
  Serre core split by character case** —
  `freyCurve_two_torsion_embedding` is PROVEN: the transformed Frey
  model has visible rational 2-torsion at `(0,0)` and `(aᵖ/4, −aᵖ/8)`
  (equation checks by `field_simp`/`ring`; nonsingularity from
  `equation_iff_nonsingular` since the curve is elliptic; order 2 via
  the negation formula `negY`; the two points differ in
  `x`-coordinate), assembled into an injective `(ℤ/2)² →+ E(ℚ)`.
  `exists_two_torsion_and_p_point_of_not_isIrreducible` is now DERIVED
  from the new disjunction node ✗ `exists_p_point_of_not_isIrreducible`
  (χ₁ = 1: p-point on the Frey curve itself, 2-torsion supplied by the
  proven lemma; χ₂ = 1: the full package on the Vélu quotient). The
  remaining Serre node isolates exactly Minkowski + Vélu. Frontier: 20.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Minkowski EXTRACTED as a faithful
  node** — `exists_p_point_of_not_isIrreducible` is now DERIVED from
  ✗ `minkowski_character_trivial` (a mod-`p` character of G_ℚ with open
  kernel unramified at every finite place — stated with
  `localInertiaGroup` and the restriction along
  `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup.map` — is trivial; to be closed against
  mathlib's `NumberField.abs_discr_gt_one` via the fixed field of the
  kernel) and ✗ `exists_p_point_of_not_isIrreducible_of_minkowski`
  (Serre's analysis with the Minkowski input as an explicit
  hypothesis; its remaining deep content is exactly Vélu quotients +
  the character bookkeeping). Frontier: 21 (one closed, two opened —
  the generic number theory now lives in its own node).
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **Minkowski route verified in mathlib**
  — reconnaissance recorded (see the session-4 reconnaissance section):
  the discriminant side of `minkowski_character_trivial` is entirely in
  mathlib at our pin (`finrank_eq_one_of_unramified` etc.); what
  remains is the fixed-field construction from the open kernel and the
  inertia dictionary. No node change this iteration; the frontier
  stays 21 with the next attack mapped in detail.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Minkowski reduced to its
  character-free subgroup form** — `minkowski_character_trivial` is
  DERIVED (the kernel of an everywhere-unramified character is an open
  normal subgroup containing every inertia image, via
  `Subgroup.map_le_iff_le_comap`); the sorry now lives in
  ✗ `open_normal_subgroup_eq_top_of_inertia_le`, a pure
  Galois/number-theoretic statement with no characters or `ZMod p`
  in sight — exactly the statement the mathlib discriminant route
  closes. Frontier: 21 (sorry relocated, interface simplified).
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **OddAbsIrred vendored, ZERO
  sorries** — `KnownIn1980s/RepresentationTheory/OddAbsIrred.lean` +
  `Slop/RepresentationTheory/OddAbsIrredSlop.lean` (495 lines, fully
  proven): for a finite-dimensional representation with some `g` having
  a one-dimensional fixed space (e.g. complex conjugation on an odd
  2-dim Galois rep), irreducible ⟺ absolutely irreducible
  (`OddRep.isIrreducible_iff_isAbsolutelyIrreducible`). Wired into the
  root. Mapped feed for the B6 chain / `mod_three` (together with the
  still-unvendored `Slop/PGL2` Dickson classification). Frontier
  unchanged: 21.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4, cont.): **Dickson classification vendored,
  ZERO sorries (13 files, ~11.5k lines)** — the full
  `Slop/PGL2/FiniteSubgroups` development plus
  `KnownIn1980s/PGL2/Defs.lean` with the classification theorems
  (`Dickson.classification_tame`: a nontrivial finite subgroup of
  `PGL₂(𝔽̄_p)` of order prime to `p` is cyclic, dihedral, A₄, S₄ or A₅;
  `Dickson.classification_wild`: order divisible by `p` gives
  elementary-abelian-by-cyclic, PSL₂/PGL₂ of a subfield, or A₅ at
  `p = 3`). VENDORING CHANGE: upstream leaves the Defs statements
  sorry-d and proves copies in `Proofs.lean`; here the shared
  definitions are split into `PGL2/Basic.lean` (breaking the import
  cycle with the Slop development) and the proofs are inlined into
  `Defs.lean`, so the whole tree is sorry-free. Wired into the root.
  Feed for `mod_three` (image-of-Galois analysis in PGL₂(𝔽₃)).
  Frontier unchanged: 21.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **explicit axiom audit of the
  session's harvest** — UNCONDITIONALLY proven (`[propext,
  Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, zero `sorryAx`):
  `Dickson.classification_tame`, `Dickson.classification_wild`,
  `OddRep.isIrreducible_iff_isAbsolutelyIrreducible`,
  `freyCurve_hasGoodReduction_of_not_dvd`,
  `freyCurve_hasMultiplicativeReduction_of_dvd`,
  `freyCurve_hasMultiplicativeReduction_at_two`,
  `freyCurve_two_torsion_embedding`, `embedding_assembly`.
  Correctly sorry-rooted (derived from open nodes):
  `minkowski_character_trivial`, `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`. Invariant intact.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **`neZero_natCast_residueField`
  PROVEN** (unconditional) — for distinct primes `q ≠ p`, `p` is
  nonzero in the residue field of `ℤ_(q)` (`p` is a unit of the
  localization; units have nonzero residue). This pre-discharges the
  `NeZero (n : ResidueField R)` hypothesis of the vendored NOS and
  finite-flat nodes for when the good-reduction glue nodes are closed
  against them.
- 2026-07-16 (session 4 close): **Tate torsion-membership lemmas
  PROVEN** — `WeierstrassCurve.mem_torsionBy_of_mem_rootsOfUnity` and
  `mem_torsionBy_of_pow_eq` (in `TateCurve.lean`): under ANY witness
  `e : Ωˣ/qᶻ ≃+ E(Ω)` of `exists_tateEquivSepClosure`, `N`-th roots of
  unity and `N`-th roots of the Tate parameter map to `N`-torsion
  points (formal: `N•[u] = [u^N]` and the class of `q` is zero).
  These serve the multiplicative/tame glue nodes, which analyze `E[p]`
  through the uniformization's torsion.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5): **MINKOWSKI SURJECTIVITY LEAF DERIVED —
  the entire Minkowski branch now rests on ONE purely local node.**
  `exists_prime_over_inertia_eq_bot_of_le_fixingSubgroup` is PROVEN
  via the valuation route (NO decomposition-group theory, NO henselian
  lifting): embed `L` into `M := ℚ_q(ι L) ⊆ ℚ_qᵃˡᵍ` along the
  `absoluteGaloisGroup.map` embedding (`lift_map` transports `hle` to
  "local inertia fixes `M` pointwise"); the NEW sorry node
  `maximalIdeal_map_eq_of_le_fixedField_localInertiaGroup`
  (`LocalInertiaFixedField.lean`, stated for GENERAL number fields
  `K` and places `v`) gives `e(M/ℚ_q) = 1`, i.e. `𝔪_M = (q)`; the
  comap prime `Q₀` of `𝔪_M` under the integrality-restricted
  `𝓞 L → 𝒪_M` then has `e(Q₀|q) = 1` (else `q ∈ Q₀²` forces
  `q ∈ (q²)`, a unit in a proper ideal), and
  `#I(Q₀) = e = 1` (`card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn` +
  `ramificationIdx'_ne_one_iff` + the old/new-spelling bridge
  `ramificationIdx'_eq_ramificationIdx`). Helper lemmas PROVEN
  unconditionally: `asIdeal_toHeightOneSpectrumRingOfIntegersRat`,
  `maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegers_eq_span`. Axiom audit: both
  helpers `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; the chain
  `exists_prime_over…` → `inertia_eq_bot_of_le_fixingSubgroup` →
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_inertia_le_fixingSubgroup` →
  `open_normal_subgroup_eq_top_of_inertia_le` carries `sorryAx` ONLY
  through the local node. Frontier stays at 22 by count, but the
  Neukirch II.9 content strictly shrank to the local statement, whose
  planned proof (Galois closure + finite-level `|I| = e` counting +
  compactness lifting) needs no new mathematical inputs beyond
  vendored/mathlib API. Lean gotchas recorded: the scoped-`algebraMap`
  coercion is `Algebra.cast` (NOT syntactically `algebraMap _ _ _` —
  build cross-spelling equalities via `.trans`-chained lemma instances
  + `convert … using 2` + `norm_cast`, never `rw`); `↥M`'s ℤ-algebra
  instance is ambiguous (`Ring.toIntAlgebra` vs
  `IntermediateField.algebra'`) — avoid `RingHom.toIntAlgHom` and
  `IsIntegral.tower_top` across the ambiguity; instead push the monic
  witness through `Polynomial.eval₂_map` + `Subsingleton.elim` on
  `ℤ →+* ·`.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5): **local node decomposition started —
  finite-level `|I| = e` stated; supporting instances PROVEN.** In
  `LocalInertiaFixedField.lean`: PROVEN unconditionally —
  `isIntegralClosure_integralClosure` (the type synonym is an
  `IsIntegralClosure`), `smulDistribClass_integralClosure` (the Galois
  action distributes over `𝒪_N`-scalars), the intermediate-field-
  restricted tower `IsScalarTower 𝒪ᵥ Kᵥ ↥M` (deliberately NOT the
  general form: a general instance enables `IntermediateField.algebra'`
  as a second route to `Algebra 𝒪ᵥ ↥M` and poisons every
  `IntegralClosure` elaboration), and
  `liesOver_maximalIdeal_integralClosure` (`𝔪_N` lies over `𝔪ᵥ`, via
  comap-maximality under integrality + locality). NEW sorry node
  `card_inertia_finite_level` (finite Galois `N/Kᵥ` has
  `#I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ)) = e`): the full instance pack for mathlib's
  `card_inertia_eq_ramificationIdxIn` is verified EXCEPT
  `Module.Flat 𝒪ᵥ 𝒪_N` — the PID/free route fails to SYNTHESIZE
  because different elaboration sites of `IntegralClosure 𝒪ᵥ ↥N`
  embed non-reducibly-unifiable `CommRing ↥N`/`Algebra 𝒪ᵥ ↥N`
  instance arguments (`Field.toCommRing ∘ IntermediateField.toField`
  vs the direct path; verified by `pp.all` on the failing goal, which
  contains `instAlgebraSubtypeMemValuationSubringVendored` while
  direct synthesis in a clean context succeeds). Fix strategy for the
  next attack: an abstract `(R S G)`-wrapper taking `Module.Free R S`
  as a hypothesis, instantiated once with a `letI`-pinned instance
  pack. Remaining plan for the L1 assembly unchanged (restriction maps
  inertia to inertia; counting surjectivity; compactness lifting; then
  `e(M) = 1` via the Galois closure). Frontier: 23 by count; the
  finite-level node is a strict sub-piece of L1's content.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5): **`card_inertia_finite_level` PROVEN**
  (unconditional; `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). The
  entire blocked synthesis was fixed by ONE line:
  `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in` on the
  theorem — the option makes the `Module.Free`/`Flat` instance
  unifications succeed across the divergent `IntegralClosure`
  elaboration spellings (the abstract-wrapper strategy was NOT
  needed). GOTCHA for the file: every theorem here that synthesizes
  module-structure classes over `IntegralClosure 𝒪ᵥ ↥N` likely needs
  the same option. Frontier back to 22. Local-node remaining pieces:
  finite-level restriction maps inertia into inertia (uses the proven
  `liesOver` instance + `𝔪_{N'} ∩ 𝒪_N = 𝔪_N`), tower
  multiplicativity of `e` (mathlib
  `ramificationIdx'_algebra_tower`), counting surjectivity
  `I(N'/Kᵥ) ↠ I(N/Kᵥ)`, compactness lifting to `localInertiaGroup`,
  and the `e(M) = 1` Galois-closure assembly.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5):
  **`restrictNormalHom_mem_inertia_of_mem_localInertiaGroup` PROVEN**
  (unconditional) — the restriction of a `localInertiaGroup` element
  to a finite Galois subextension `N` lies in the inertia of `𝔪_N` in
  `Gal(N/Kᵥ)`. Supporting pieces PROVEN: `integralClosureInclusion`
  (`𝒪_N →+* 𝒪_{Kᵥᵃˡᵍ}` by codRestrict + integrality transport along
  the `𝒪ᵥ`-algebra tower) and the tower instance
  `IsScalarTower 𝒪ᵥ ↥M E` (ambient-target form, middle an
  intermediate-field subtype — still avoids the `algebra'` ambiguity).
  KEY SIMPLIFICATION discovered: `ι⁻¹(𝔪_big) ≤ 𝔪_N` is FREE from
  locality of `𝒪_N` (a proper ideal of a local ring sits under the
  maximal ideal — `IsLocalRing.le_maximalIdeal`; no integrality, no
  comap-maximality needed for the INTO direction). Next pieces:
  `IsDiscreteValuationRing 𝒪_N` (ValuationRing + Noetherian ⟹ PID),
  finite-to-finite restriction + counting surjectivity, compactness
  lifting, `e(M) = 1` assembly.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5): **`isDiscreteValuationRing_integralClosure`
  PROVEN** (instance; unconditional) — `𝒪_N` is a DVR for every finite
  subextension `N/Kᵥ`: ValuationRing (vendored spectral-norm) + PID
  (mathlib's Bézout+Noetherian instance, Noetherian via
  `IsIntegralClosure.isNoetherianRing`) + local + not-a-field (vendored
  `not_isField_integralClosure` + the newly proven
  `adicCompletionIntegers_ne_top`, itself from `𝒪ᵥ = ⊤` forcing
  `IsField 𝒪ᵥ` against the DVR's `not_a_field`). This unlocks the
  M-based instance pack for the second `card_inertia` application
  (base `𝒪_M`, Dedekind for the `e`-tower lemma). ASSEMBLY MAP refined:
  `e(M)=1` follows from `I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ)) ≤ Gal(N/M)` (surjectivity +
  `hM`), `|I over Kᵥ| = e(N/Kᵥ)` (proven), `|inertia over M| = e(N/M)`
  (M-based card_inertia, needs `letI Algebra ↥M ↥N` inclusion
  gymnastics + residue finiteness of `𝒪_M`), and
  `e(N/Kᵥ) = e(N/M)·e(M)` (mathlib `ramificationIdx'_algebra_tower`,
  Dedekind hypotheses now available). Then compactness lifting
  (`Γ Kᵥ` profinite; `localInertiaGroup` closed via locally-constant
  evaluation; finite-to-finite surjectivity by the same counting) and
  the `map 𝔪ᵥ = 𝔪_M ↔ e(M) = 1` conversion.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5):
  **`maximalIdeal_map_eq_of_ramificationIdx_eq_one` PROVEN**
  (unconditional) — `e = 1 ⟹ map 𝔪ᵥ = 𝔪_N`, via the DVR ideal
  classification (`ideal_eq_span_pow_irreducible`: the mapped ideal is
  `(ϖⁿ)`; `n ≥ 1` from the proven `LiesOver`, `n < 2` from
  `ramificationIdx'_ne_one_iff`). This is the L1 endgame conversion:
  the final assembly now reduces to producing
  `ramificationIdx' (𝔪ᵥ) (𝔪_M) = 1` from `hM` via the Galois closure
  counting. Remaining for L1: M-based `card_inertia` (inclusion-algebra
  gymnastics + `𝒪_M` residue finiteness), `e`-tower application,
  compactness lifting of finite-level inertia to `localInertiaGroup`,
  final assembly.
- 2026-07-16 (session 5, design note for the M-based counting):
  mathlib's `stabilizerHom_surjective` (Frobenius lifting) requires
  `[Finite G]` — NO profinite shortcut; the compactness plan stands.
  For the second `card_inertia` (base `𝒪_M`, group `Gal(N/M)`), the
  clean formulation avoids `letI` inclusion-algebras: reify `M` inside
  `↥N` as `M' : IntermediateField Kᵥ ↥N` (via
  `IntermediateField.comap N.val` from `M ≤ N`, or by generalizing the
  whole `FiniteLevel` section from subextensions of `Kᵥᵃˡᵍ` to an
  arbitrary finite extension `E/Kᵥ`); then `Algebra ↥M' ↥N`,
  `IsGalois ↥M' ↥N` (tower-top), and
  `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroupEquiv : fixingSubgroup M' ≃* Gal(N/M')`
  are all CANONICAL instances. Generalizing the section to arbitrary
  `E` is the right move (all inputs — vendored `valuationRing`,
  `IsIntegralClosure.finite`, Bézout-PID, `not_isField` — are already
  ambient-free); the only IntermediateField-specific pieces are my two
  tower instances, whose subtype-restriction guards the `algebra'`
  ambiguity — for a general-`E` section the guard concern moves to the
  INSTANTIATION sites, where the proven
  `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false` fix applies. The
  assembly chain: `τ ∈ I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ))` fixing `M` ⟹ `τ` upgrades
  through `fixingSubgroupEquiv` to `Gal(N/M')`, lands in
  `I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/M'))` (`Ideal.coe_mem_inertia`-style), so
  `e(N/Kᵥ) = |I(𝔪_N/GalKᵥ)| ≤ |I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/M'))| = e(N/M')`; with
  `e(N/Kᵥ) = e(N/M')·e(M/Kᵥ)` (`ramificationIdx'_algebra_tower`,
  Dedekind ✓ both DVRs) and `e ≠ 0`, conclude `e(M/Kᵥ) = 1`.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **`card_inertia_intermediate` PROVEN**
  (unconditional) — `|I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/M'))| = e(𝔪_{M'} in 𝒪_N)` for any
  intermediate `M'` of a finite Galois `N/Kᵥ`, using the
  intermediate-base algebra layer and the new
  `hasFiniteQuotients_adicCompletionIntegers` (every nonzero ideal of
  the DVR `𝒪ᵥ` is `𝔪ᵥⁿ`; finite quotients by induction with
  `Submodule.finite_quotient_smul`; then
  `Ring.HasFiniteQuotients.of_module_finite` transports to `𝒪_{M'}`).
  Debug notes: `Submodule.mkQ`-based `Module.Finite` haveI's EXPLODE
  under respectTransparency-false (module-structure unification) — use
  ring-level routes (`Module.Finite.trans`, `HasFiniteQuotients`);
  `of_module_finite` takes `R` EXPLICITLY. Both counting inputs for the
  L1 assembly are now in place; remaining: the `e`-tower application
  (`ramificationIdx'_algebra_tower` over `𝒪ᵥ → 𝒪_{M'} → 𝒪_N`), the
  fixing-subgroup upgrade `I(𝔪_N/GalKᵥ) ∩ fix(M') ↪ I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/M'))`,
  compactness lifting, and the final assembly.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE COUNTING COMBINER
  `ramificationIdx_eq_one_of_inertia_le_fixingSubgroup` PROVEN**
  (unconditional) — the mathematical HEART of the local node: if
  `I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ))` fixes the intermediate field `M'` pointwise, then
  `e(𝔪ᵥ at 𝔪_{M'}) = 1`. Both card lemmas were upgraded to conclude in
  `ramificationIdx'` form (conversions inside their own instance
  packs); the combiner chains the `fixingSubgroupEquiv` upgrade
  injection, `Ideal.ramificationIdx'_algebra_tower'` (Dedekind ✓ both
  DVRs), and
  `Ideal.IsDedekindDomain.ramificationIdx'_ne_zero_of_liesOver`
  (NOTE the namespace: it lives inside `namespace IsDedekindDomain`
  within `namespace Ideal`). With
  `maximalIdeal_map_eq_of_ramificationIdx_eq_one`, L1 now reduces to:
  (a) the COMPACTNESS LIFTING — `I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ)) ⊆ π_N(I_v)` for the
  Galois closure `N` (finite-to-finite surjectivity comes from the
  SAME combiner pattern applied to towers `N ⊆ N'` + the proven
  restriction lemma; then profinite compactness) — and (b) the final
  glue: `N := normalClosure`, reify `M` as `M' ⊆ ↥N`, transport
  `e(M') = 1` back to the subextension `M` (ring iso
  `𝒪_{M'} ≅ 𝒪_M` from `M' ≅ M` as `Kᵥ`-extensions).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **FINITE-LEVEL INERTIA SURJECTIVITY PROVEN**
  (`restrictNormalHom_inertia_surjective`, unconditional) — for normal
  `M' ⊆ N` finite over `Kᵥ`, the restriction maps `I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/Kᵥ))`
  ONTO `I(𝔪_{M'}/Gal(M'/Kᵥ))`. First-isomorphism counting:
  `|A| = |ker f|·|range f|`; `|ker f| = |I(𝔪_N/Gal(N/M'))|` via
  TWO-WAY INJECTIONS + `Nat.le_antisymm` (round-trip `Equiv`
  coherence proofs kept failing on beta-redex/`Subtype.ext` layers —
  the two-injection pattern is far more robust); the counts and tower
  from the previous lemmas; `Subgroup.eq_of_le_of_card_ge` closes.
  Also PROVEN: `restrictNormalHom_mem_inertia_intermediate`
  (restriction-into at the (E, M') level). The local node now needs
  ONLY: profinite compactness lifting (Γ compact, `localInertiaGroup`
  closed, directed system over finite Galois levels — all finite-level
  inputs now proven) and the final normalClosure/reification glue.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, compactness-arc plan): `CompactSpace (Γ Kᵥ)`
  is a vendored GLOBAL instance
  (`Fermat/FLT/Mathlib/FieldTheory/Galois/Infinite.lean`, any algebraic
  extension). Target:
  `∃ σ ∈ localInertiaGroup v, restrictNormalHom N σ = τ` for
  `τ ∈ I(𝔪_N)`, `N` finite Galois subextension of `Kᵥᵃˡᵍ`. Plan:
  (1) TRANSPORT LAYER for `N ≤ N'` subextensions: reify
  `M' := comap N'.val N : IntermediateField Kᵥ ↥N'`, build the
  `Kᵥ`-AlgEquiv `↥M' ≃ₐ[Kᵥ] ↥N`, conjugate `IC`/`𝔪`/inertia across
  it (`ramificationIdx'_comap_eq` for `e`-invariance if needed), and
  intertwine `restrictNormalHom` with the two restriction maps
  (`AlgEquiv.restrictNormal_trans`-family for
  `res_N = res_{N'→N} ∘ π_{N'}`); this turns the proven `(E, M')`
  surjectivity into subextension-pair surjectivity
  `I(𝔪_{N'}) ↠ I(𝔪_N)`. (2) CLOSED SETS
  `D_{N'} := π_N⁻¹{τ} ∩ π_{N'}⁻¹(I(𝔪_{N'}))` for finite Galois
  `N' ⊇ N`: closed via continuity of `restrictNormalHom` into finite
  discrete targets (check mathlib `continuous_restrictNormalHom`);
  nonempty via (1) + `restrictNormalHom_surjective`; DIRECTED via
  restriction-into + compositum (finite Galois subextensions are
  directed). (3) `IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_directed_nonempty_...`
  gives `σ*`; `σ* ∈ localInertiaGroup` because every `x ∈ IC-big`
  lies in some finite Galois `N'` (normal closure of `Kᵥ⟮x⟯`) and
  `ι(𝔪_{N'}) ⊆ 𝔪_big` (the comap EQUALITY: `≤` by locality — proven
  pattern — and `⊇` by `isMaximal_comap_of_isIntegral`, `𝔪_big`
  maximal since `IC-big` is a local valuation ring).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **compactness arc: ALL FINITE-LEVEL PIECES
  PROVEN** (each unconditional): `autCongr_mem_inertia` (inertia
  transport along `Kᵥ`-isos, via two-sided-inverse codRestrict pair),
  `reifySubextension`/`reifyEquiv`/`normal_reifySubextension`
  (reification of `N ≤ N'` with `Normal.of_algEquiv`; the FORWARD map
  preserves ambient values definitionally, `.symm` is choice-opaque —
  always route value computations through `apply_symm_apply`),
  `restrictNormalHom_reify_compat` (`π_N = autCongr ∘ res_reify ∘
  π_{N'}`, three `restrictNormal_commutes` chases),
  `integralClosureInclusion_mem_maximalIdeal` (`ι(𝔪_N) ⊆ 𝔪_big`),
  `restrict_mem_inertia_of_le` (directedness content),
  `exists_inertia_restrict_of_le` (D-set nonemptiness content).
  GOTCHA: explicit `haveI : Normal ... := IsGalois.to_normal` needed
  at use sites — the general valuation-subring tower instance makes
  failing instance searches explode on metavariable goals. REMAINING
  FOR L1 (two pieces): (i) the topological intersection theorem —
  index `ι := {N' // N ≤ N' ∧ FD ∧ IsGalois}` (nonempty: `⟨N, le_rfl,
  ..⟩`), `D N' := π_N⁻¹{τ} ∩ π_{N'}⁻¹(I(𝔪_{N'}))`, closed
  (`InfiniteGalois.restrictNormalHom_continuous` + T1 finite),
  nonempty (`exists_inertia_restrict_of_le`), directed (compositum
  `N'₁ ⊔ N'₂`, `normal_sup` + FD-sup instances,
  `restrict_mem_inertia_of_le`), then
  `IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_directed_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed`
  (`CompactSpace (Γ Kᵥ)` vendored) and membership in
  `localInertiaGroup` via `normalClosure Kᵥ (N ⊔ Kᵥ⟮x⟯) Kᵥᵃˡᵍ` +
  `restrictNormal_commutes` + `integralClosureInclusion_mem_maximalIdeal`;
  (ii) L1 assembly — `N := normalClosure Kᵥ M Kᵥᵃˡᵍ`, `hfix` from (i)
  + `hM`, `ramificationIdx_eq_one_of_inertia_le_fixingSubgroup`
  (counting combiner) at `M' := reify M`, transport `e = 1` back
  across `reifyEquiv` (extract the `f₁/f₂` pair of
  `autCongr_mem_inertia` as a named `RingEquiv` and use
  `ramificationIdx'_comap_eq`, or transport the final map-equality
  directly), then `maximalIdeal_map_eq_of_ramificationIdx_eq_one`.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE COMPACTNESS LIFTING IS PROVEN**
  (`exists_mem_localInertiaGroup_restrictNormalHom_eq`, unconditional
  — the PROFINITE half of Neukirch II.9.11): every inertia element at
  a finite Galois level `N` is the restriction of an element of
  `localInertiaGroup v`. Directed closed sets
  `D_{N'} = π_N⁻¹{τ} ∩ π_{N'}⁻¹(I(𝔪_{N'}))` in the compact `Γ Kᵥ`;
  nonempty by `exists_inertia_restrict_of_le`; directed via composita
  and `restrict_mem_inertia_of_le`; a point of the intersection lies
  in `localInertiaGroup` because every element of the big integral
  closure lives at the finite Galois level
  `normalClosure Kᵥ (N ⊔ Kᵥ⟮z⟯) Kᵥᵃˡᵍ` (existential-package pattern —
  `set`-bound `Nx` blocks instance matching; provide
  `∃ Nx, N ≤ Nx ∧ z ∈ Nx ∧ FD ∧ IsGalois` and `obtain`). Whole-arc
  axiom audit clean. THE LOCAL NODE L1 NOW NEEDS ONLY ITS FINAL
  ASSEMBLY (piece (ii) above).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): ★★★ **THE LOCAL NODE IS PROVEN — THE ENTIRE
  MINKOWSKI BRANCH IS CLOSED UNCONDITIONALLY.** ★★★
  `maximalIdeal_map_eq_of_le_fixedField_localInertiaGroup` (Neukirch
  II.9.11, "the fixed field of the local inertia group is unramified")
  is sorry-free: Galois closure + compactness lifting turns `hM` into
  finite-level inertia fixing the reified `M`; the counting combiner
  gives `e = 1`; the `𝒪ᵥ`-algebra isomorphism of integral closures
  (two-sided codRestrict pair, `comap 𝔪 = 𝔪` by nonunit transport)
  transports `e = 1` across `reifyEquiv`
  (`ramificationIdx'_comap_eq`); the DVR conversion closes. AXIOM
  AUDIT OF THE WHOLE CHAIN — L1 →
  `exists_prime_over_inertia_eq_bot_of_le_fixingSubgroup` →
  `inertia_eq_bot_of_le_fixingSubgroup` →
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_inertia_le_fixingSubgroup` →
  `open_normal_subgroup_eq_top_of_inertia_le` →
  `minkowski_character_trivial` — ALL
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, ZERO `sorryAx`.
  "ℚ has no nontrivial everywhere-unramified extension" (in the
  subgroup and character forms the tree consumes) is now a THEOREM,
  via a from-scratch formalization of local ramification theory:
  finite-level Hilbert `|I| = e` counting + profinite compactness —
  NO decomposition groups, NO henselian lifting, no new axioms.
  Frontier: 21 nodes. The transport family is now available PROVEN for
  the two `IsUnramifiedAt` glue nodes (next consumers).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, next-arc setup): the glue node
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasGoodReduction` derivation from the vendored
  NOS leaf (`torsion_unramified_of_good_reduction`,
  `GoodReduction.lean`) needs: (1) the valuation subring
  `𝒪 := comap ι (valuation ring of ℚ̄_q)` of `ℚ̄` over `R = ℤ_(q)`
  (`h𝒪`-compatibility to verify); (2) the SPELLING BRIDGE between
  `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup k` (the NOS statement's inertia)
  and the image of `localInertiaGroup q` under
  `absoluteGaloisGroup.map` (via `lift_map`, mirroring the proven
  embedding-prime transport); (3) the identification of
  `(ρ.toLocal q)`'s action on `E.galoisRep`'s space with
  `Affine.Point.map` on `p`-torsion (unfold `galoisRep`/`toLocal`).
  Then `IsUnramifiedAt` = `localInertiaGroup ≤ ker` follows. The
  `IsFlatAt` glue is the same pattern against
  `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` plus the `ℤ_(p) → ℤ_p` base
  change of the prolongation package. VERIFIED (2026-07-17):
  `E.galoisRep`'s action is `DistribMulAction.toAddMonoidEnd` of the
  ambient `(Kᵃˡᵍ ≃ₐ[K] Kᵃˡᵍ)`-action on `(E⁄Kᵃˡᵍ).Point` restricted
  to `nTorsion` (`Torsion.lean:179-194`), and
  `GaloisRep.toLocal ρ v = ρ ∘ absoluteGaloisGroup.map` (abbrev,
  `GaloisRep.lean:309`) — so for `σ ∈ localInertiaGroup`,
  `(ρ.toLocal v) σ = 1` UNFOLDS to "`map σ` fixes every `p`-torsion
  point via `Point.map`", which is EXACTLY the NOS conclusion at
  `σ' := map σ`. The glue therefore reduces to: (a) the 𝒪-construction
  + `h𝒪`, (b) `map σ ∈ 𝒪.inertiaSubgroup`-form (the spelling bridge:
  `inertiaSubgroup` is the kernel of the decomposition-subgroup action
  on `κ(𝒪)` — relate to the `𝔪(IC)`-inertia through `ι` and
  `lift_map`), (c) the `DistribMulAction`-vs-`Point.map` and
  `ker`-membership unfoldings (`AddMonoidHom.ext` on torsion
  generators).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, recon): `integralClosureValuationSubring`
  (PROVEN def) bundles `IC 𝒪ᵥ L` as a `ValuationSubring L`; take
  `𝒪 := (integralClosureValuationSubring v Kᵥᵃˡᵍ).comap
  (AlgebraicClosure.map f)` (`ValuationSubring.comap` ✓ mathlib). The
  `h𝒪`-compatibility `(𝒪.comap (algebraMap ℚ ℚ̄)).toSubring =
  (algebraMap ℤ_(q) ℚ).range` unfolds via `map_algebraMap` to
  `f x ∈ IC-big ↔ f x ∈ 𝒪ᵥ` (integrality restricted to `Kᵥ`; `𝒪ᵥ`
  integrally closed) and then to
  `v.valuation ℚ x ≤ 1 ↔ x ∈ range (ℤ_(q) → ℚ)` — the ONE-PLACE
  analogue of mathlib's `mem_integers_of_valuation_le_one`
  (`AdicValuation.lean:423`, all-places): prove for
  `Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal` by mirroring its
  `IsLocalization.surj` + factor-count argument at the single place,
  or through the `IsLocalization.AtPrime` unit-criteria already used
  in `Semistable.lean`. BETTER (verified): mathlib ALREADY HAS the
  one-place criterion —
  `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationSubringAtPrime` (the
  localization at `v` as a `ValuationSubring K`) with
  `valuationSubringAtPrime_eq_valuationSubring` (equality with
  `(valuation K v).valuationSubring`, `AdicValuation.lean:~509`). So
  `h𝒪` is pure assembly: `x ∈ 𝒪.comap (aM ℚ ℚ̄)` ⟺ (via
  `map_algebraMap`) `aM Kᵥ Kᵥᵃˡᵍ (f x) ∈ IC-big` ⟺ `f x ∈ 𝒪ᵥ`
  (`IsIntegrallyClosed.isIntegral_iff` — integral closure of `𝒪ᵥ` in
  its OWN fraction field) ⟺ `Valued.v (f x) ≤ 1`
  (`mem_adicCompletionIntegers`) ⟺ `v.valuation ℚ x ≤ 1`
  (`valuedAdicCompletion_eq_valuation'`) ⟺
  `x ∈ valuationSubringAtPrime ℚ v` (mathlib equality) ⟺
  `x ∈ range (Localization.AtPrime → ℚ)` (IsLocalization
  uniqueness/`algEquiv` between the two localization models).
  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES for `h𝒪` (design fixed, first draft reverted
  for cleanliness): `valuationSubringAtPrime` membership is BY
  DEFINITION `∃ a s (_ : s ∈ v.asIdeal.primeCompl), x = aM a *
  (aM s)⁻¹` (`Localization.subalgebra.ofField` carrier,
  `AsSubring.lean:127`, membership Iff.rfl after the two mathlib
  rewrites `Valuation.mem_valuationSubring_iff` +
  `valuationSubringAtPrime_eq_valuationSubring`). CRUCIAL: there is
  NO global `Algebra (Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal) K` instance —
  state `h𝒪` with the SAME hypothesis pack as the Semistable glue
  nodes (`[Algebra (Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal) K]`
  `[IsScalarTower (𝓞 K) (Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal) K]`
  `[IsFractionRing (Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal) K]`, mirroring
  `instAlgebraLocalizationAtPrimeRat`'s package), and bridge the
  `∃`-form to `(algebraMap Loc K).range` with
  `IsLocalization.mk'_surjective` + `IsLocalization.lift_mk'`/tower
  compatibility. Steps 1–3 of the chain drafted and typecheck-shaped:
  step1 `show ... ∈ integralClosure ...; rw [AlgebraicClosure.map_algebraMap]; rfl`;
  step2 `isIntegral_algebraMap_iff` +
  `IsIntegrallyClosed.integralClosure_eq_bot`; step3
  `mem_adicCompletionIntegers` + `valuedAdicCompletion_eq_valuation'`.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **`embeddedValuationSubring_comap_toSubring`
  PROVEN** (unconditional) — the `h𝒪`-compatibility: the pullback of
  the embedded valuation subring to `K` equals the range of
  `Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal` (with the localization algebra
  pack as hypotheses). The four-step chain compiled as designed; the
  range-bridge via `mk'`-calculus (`mk'_surjective` is a
  `Surjective`-over-PAIRS statement — destructure `⟨⟨a, s⟩, hys⟩`;
  `mk'_spec` + tower + `eq_mul_inv_iff_mul_eq₀`). NOS-glue piece (a)
  done. Remaining: (b) the `inertiaSubgroup` spelling bridge (image
  of `localInertiaGroup` lands in `𝒪.inertiaSubgroup K`:
  decomposition-membership = stabilizing `𝒪`, then triviality on
  `κ(𝒪)` from `𝔪(IC)`-inertia through `lift_map` and the
  residue-field comparison), (c) the `ker`-unfolding in the glue node
  itself.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE SPELLING BRIDGE IS PROVEN** (all
  unconditional): `map_smul_embeddedValuationSubring` (the image of
  ANY `Γ Kᵥ`-element stabilizes `𝒪`, via `lift_map` + integrality
  stability both ways), `embeddedComparison` (the codRestrict
  comparison hom into the big integral closure),
  `mem_maximalIdeal_iff_embeddedComparison` (unit REFLECTION: an
  inverse upstairs restricts along the comap; `𝔪`-membership is
  detected upstairs), and
  `map_mem_inertiaSubgroup_of_mem_localInertiaGroup` (THE bridge:
  the image of a local inertia element lies in
  `𝒪.inertiaSubgroup K` — residue triviality via
  `IsLocalRing.ResidueField.residue_smul` (NOTE the full namespace)
  + `Ideal.Quotient.eq` + the detection lemma; needs
  `public import Mathlib.RingTheory.Valuation.RamificationGroup`).
  NOS-glue pieces (a) and (b) DONE. Remaining: (c) assemble
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasGoodReduction` in `Semistable.lean` — apply
  the vendored NOS node at `𝒪 := embeddedValuationSubring`,
  `h𝒪 := embeddedValuationSubring_comap_toSubring` (hypothesis pack
  present there), the bridge for inertia membership, and unfold
  `(ρ.toLocal q).ker`-membership to the pointwise torsion statement
  (`AddMonoidHom.ext`-style on the `nTorsion` action; `galoisRep`'s
  action is the ambient `DistribMulAction`, so the NOS conclusion is
  the needed fixing statement at `map σ`). Check the NOS node's exact
  variable pack (R k ksep n E instances) when instantiating.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **`isUnramifiedAt_of_hasGoodReduction`
  DERIVED — frontier 21 → 20.** The good-reduction unramifiedness glue
  now rests SOLELY on the vendored NOS leaf
  (`torsion_unramified_of_good_reduction`): instantiate at
  `𝒪 := embeddedValuationSubring` with
  `h𝒪 := embeddedValuationSubring_comap_toSubring` (Semistable's
  localization pack in scope), inertia membership by the spelling
  bridge, `NeZero` by `neZero_natCast_residueField` (MOVED before the
  glue node — single-pass file order), and the `ker`-membership closed
  by `show (ρ.toLocal v) σ = 1` (the `toLocal`-SPELLED form — the
  `ρ (map σ)`-spelling is NOT accepted by `show` even though
  ker-membership itself is defeq to application-eq) +
  `LinearMap.ext` + `Subtype.ext` + the NOS conclusion verbatim
  (`Point.map` matches the ambient action definitionally; the
  torsion-membership bridge is `Submodule.mem_torsionBy_iff` +
  `exact_mod_cast`). Axiom audit: `sorryAx` ONLY through the NOS
  leaf. Gate-only full build. NEXT: the same pattern for
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (against the Tate
  machinery — MORE content: unipotent-not-trivial inertia, quadratic
  twist; see the node's docstring) and the two `IsFlatAt` glue nodes
  (against `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`, plus the `ℤ_(p) → ℤ_p`
  prolongation base change).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5):
  **`isUnramifiedAt_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` DERIVED** — the
  multiplicative-prime unramifiedness glue decomposes exactly like the
  good-reduction one: NEW sorry node
  `torsion_unramified_of_multiplicative_reduction` (the pure
  TATE-THEORETIC content — quadratic twist + Tate uniformization +
  `p ∣ v_q(j)` p-th-power analysis — stated in the SAME
  `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup`/`Point.map` shape as the vendored
  NOS node, with the `h𝒪`-hypothesis in the same range-form), and the
  glue itself is a VERBATIM copy of the good-reduction transport.
  Frontier stays 20 by count; the transport content of the node is
  eliminated. NOTE: `E⁄A` is `WeierstrassCurve.baseChange E A`
  (scoped notation in `VariableChange.lean`/`Weierstrass.lean`) — the
  leaf must be stated with `(E⁄ℚ̄).Point` (single base change from ℚ,
  the NOS shape); the glue's `(E.map ..)⁄ℚ̄`-spelled points unify with
  it definitionally at application time. `GoodReduction` is now a
  PUBLIC import of `Semistable.lean` (the leaf's statement needs the
  `inertiaSubgroup` language).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, flat-transport design): mathlib HAS Hopf base
  change (`Mathlib.RingTheory.HopfAlgebra.TensorProduct`:
  `HopfAlgebra S (B ⊗[R] A)` under towers). The `IsFlatAt` glue arc:
  (i) the algebra `ℤ_(p) → 𝒪ᵥ` (codRestrict along the valuation
  criterion — the `h𝒪`-chain tools apply); (ii)
  `G := 𝒪ᵥ ⊗[ℤ_(p)] H` from the vendored leaf's package `H`
  (flat/finite by base change; étale generic fibre by base-change
  associativity `Kᵥ ⊗[𝒪ᵥ] G ≅ Kᵥ ⊗[ℚ] (ℚ ⊗[ℤ_(p)] H)` + étale base
  change); (iii) points comparison
  `Homs_{Kᵥ}(Kᵥ ⊗ G, Kᵥᵃˡᵍ) ≃ Homs_ℚ(ℚ⊗H, Kᵥᵃˡᵍ) ≃ Homs_ℚ(ℚ⊗H, ℚ̄)`
  — tensor-hom adjunction + "finite ℚ-algebra maps into `Kᵥᵃˡᵍ` land
  in `ι(ℚ̄)`" (the image is algebraic over ℚ; `ι(ℚ̄)` is the algebraic
  closure of ℚ inside `Kᵥᵃˡᵍ`); (iv) `Γ Kᵥ`-equivariance through
  `lift_map` against the leaf's `Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)`-equivariance; (v) the
  `∀`-open-ideal quantifier of `IsFlatAt`: for `A = ZMod p`, `I = ⊥`
  is the leaf package and `I = ⊤` the ZERO module (tiny standalone
  package `G := 𝒪ᵥ`, one-point homs ≃ zero space); intermediate `I`
  don't occur for prime `p` (or handle by quotient-torsion).
  Multi-iteration arc; start with (i).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): flat-arc steps (i) and (v-degenerate) PROVEN
  (`localizationToAdicCompletionIntegers` +
  `algebraMap_localization_mem_adicCompletionIntegers`;
  `GaloisRep.hasFlatProlongationAt_of_subsingleton` in the NEW module
  `Deformations/RepresentationTheory/FlatProlongation.lean` — trivial
  Hopf `𝒪ᵥ`, unique generic point via `Algebra.TensorProduct.rid` +
  `Algebra.Etale.of_equiv`, zero comparison map between singletons).
  PLUMBING NOTES for (ii)–(iv): use
  `Algebra.TensorProduct.cancelBaseChange` for
  `Kᵥ ⊗[𝒪ᵥ] (𝒪ᵥ ⊗[ℤ_(q)] H) ≃ₐ Kᵥ ⊗[ℤ_(q)] H`; MIND THE GROUP
  STRUCTURES — the vendored leaf's points are
  `Additive (WithConv (K ⊗ H →ₐ Ksep))` while `HasFlatProlongationAt`
  uses bare `Additive (Kᵥ ⊗ G →ₐ Kᵥᵃˡᵍ)` (the convolution AddMonoid
  must come from an instance on hom-sets out of Hopf algebras —
  reconcile the two spellings when building the comparison); the
  transport should be stated for `ρ : GaloisRep ℚ A M` with a
  leaf-shaped equivariant iso onto `M`-with-the-`ρ`-action, then
  specialized to the elliptic case. FOUND: the bare-hom `Monoid`
  instance behind `HasFlatProlongationAt`'s `Additive (… →ₐ …)` is
  the VENDORED convolution instance in
  `Deformations/RepresentationTheory/Etale.lean:30`
  (`Monoid (A →ₐ[K] L)` for `Bialgebra K A`); the leaf's
  `WithConv`-wrapped structure is mathlib's — the reconciling
  `MulEquiv` should be identity-underlying (`WithConv` is a
  def-wrapper). SCRATCH-VERIFIED (2026-07-17): with
  `letI := (localizationToAdicCompletionIntegers v).toAlgebra`, the
  instance `HopfAlgebra 𝒪ᵥ (𝒪ᵥ ⊗[ℤ_(q)] H)` SYNTHESIZES from
  mathlib's tensor-product Hopf instance (needs `noncomputable`,
  respectTransparency, 1M synth heartbeats) — step (ii)'s core is
  viable end-to-end. Next session: build the main transport
  (`G := 𝒪ᵥ ⊗[ℤ_(q)] H`, flat/finite by base change, étale generic
  fibre by `cancelBaseChange`, the three-layer points comparison with
  equivariance, and the `IsFlatAt` assembly over the two open ideals
  of `ZMod p`).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **BOTH `IsFlatAt` GLUE NODES DERIVED — all
  five original local-global glue nodes are now closed onto content
  leaves plus ONE shared transport.** New sorry node
  `GaloisRep.isFlatAt_of_dvr_package` (`FlatProlongation.lean` — the
  shared flat transport: DVR-package over `ℤ_(q)` with equivariant
  `WithConv`-points iso onto the rep's space ⟹ `IsFlatAt`; all
  ingredients proven or scratch-verified per the design log above).
  `isFlatAt_of_hasGoodReduction` DERIVED from
  [`torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` (vendored leaf) + the transport]:
  the `AddSubgroup.torsionBy`/`nTorsion` bridge is an
  identity-underlying `AddEquiv` (`AddSubgroup.torsionBy` is
  REDUCIBLY `(Submodule.torsionBy ℤ A n).toAddSubgroup`), and the
  equivariance transports by `Subtype.ext` + the leaf's statement
  verbatim. `isFlatAt_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` DERIVED from the
  NEW leaf `torsion_flat_of_multiplicative_reduction` (pure
  peu-ramifiée Tate content, stated in the SAME DVR-package `∃`-shape
  so the shared transport applies verbatim) + the transport. Frontier
  stays 20 by count; the transport content of both flat glue nodes is
  now concentrated in ONE node whose design is fully de-risked.
  GOTCHAS: the `⊗[R]` notation needs `open TensorProduct`; the
  `WithConv`-monoid needs `Mathlib.RingTheory.Bialgebra.Convolution`
  + `HopfAlgebra.TensorProduct` PUBLIC (statement-level); `∃ (_ : C)`
  binders DO provide instances for the rest of the `∃`-body.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, flat-transport layer C PROVEN):
  `mem_range_algebraicClosureMap_of_isIntegral` (integral elements of
  `Kᵥᵃˡᵍ` over `K` land in `ι(Kᵃˡᵍ)`: minpoly splits over `Kᵃˡᵍ`,
  `Polynomial.Splits.roots_map` pushes the root multiset through `ι`),
  `algebraicClosureMapAlgHom` (`ι` as a `K`-AlgHom; `commutes'` by
  `show`-normalizing to `AlgebraicClosure.map_algebraMap` + the
  scalar-tower unfolding), and `algHomEquivOfFinite (B) [Module.Finite
  K B] : (B →ₐ[K] Kᵥᵃˡᵍ) ≃ (B →ₐ[K] Kᵃˡᵍ)` — postcomposition with `ι`
  is a bijection on points of a finite `K`-algebra. All three audit to
  the standard axioms. GOTCHAS: `AlgHom.codRestrict` wants a
  `Subalgebra`, but `AlgHom.fieldRange` is an `IntermediateField` —
  use `AlgHom.range` + `AlgEquiv.ofInjective` (Subalgebra-valued,
  injectivity via `.toRingHom.injective`) instead of
  `ofInjectiveField`; the round-trip `rw [AlgEquiv.apply_symm_apply]`
  fails through the `AlgHom.comp` coercion layers — `refine
  (….apply_symm_apply _).trans ?_` unifies up to defeq and works.
  Remaining for `isFlatAt_of_dvr_package`: layer A (`cancelBaseChange`
  precomposition equiv), layer B (tensor-hom adjunction
  `Algebra.TensorProduct.lift`-style points identification),
  convolution-monoid compatibility of each layer, equivariance, and
  the `ZMod p` two-open-ideals assembly.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE ENTIRE SHARED FLAT TRANSPORT IS
  SORRY-FREE** (frontier 20 → 19). Completed in three moves. (1)
  `isFlatAt_of_dvr_package` DERIVED (over a FIELD `A`) from a new
  smaller core node by the two-ideal split: `⊤` via the subsingleton
  case, `⊥` via the PROVEN `HasFlatProlongationAt.of_addEquiv`
  (equivariant transport of the package across an `AddEquiv` of
  spaces; the identification `M ≃+ (A ⧸ ⊥) ⊗[A] M` via
  `AlgEquiv.quotientBot` + `baseChange_tmul`). (2) The convolution
  layer lemmas: mathlib's `AlgHom.liftEquiv` (tensor-hom adjunction)
  respects the convolution unit/product/postcomposition — the
  inverse direction by computing `comul` on the base-changed
  bialgebra (`Bialgebra.TensorProduct.comul_eq_algHom_toLinearMap`,
  induction over `comul a`), the forward direction by
  symm-injectivity; the vendored bare-hom `Monoid` of `Etale.lean`
  agrees with mathlib's `WithConv` monoid at rfl-level
  (`vendored_one/mul_eq_conv*`); `algHomEquivOfFinite` respects
  convolution (`AlgHom.comp_convMul_distrib` — postcomposition with
  `ι` distributes) and intertwines `Γ Kᵥ`-postcomposition with
  `Γ ℚ`-postcomposition (`Field.absoluteGaloisGroup.lift_map`). (3)
  `hasFlatProlongationAt_of_hopf_package` (general `K`, abstract
  coefficient ring `R`): witness `G := 𝒪ᵥ ⊗[R] H` (Hopf/finite/flat
  by base-change instances — `Mathlib.RingTheory.HopfAlgebra.
  TensorProduct` must be imported EXPLICITLY, module system does not
  re-export it through GaloisRep), étale generic fibre via
  `cancelBaseChange R K Kᵥ Kᵥ H` + `(cancelBaseChange R 𝒪ᵥ Kᵥ Kᵥ
  H).symm` + `Algebra.Etale.baseChange`, points comparison
  `dvrPointsEquiv` = `liftEquiv.symm ∘ liftEquiv.symm ∘ liftEquiv ∘
  algHomEquivOfFinite` (NO cancelBaseChange needed for points), f'
  assembled with inline `by` blocks. The ℚ-instantiation
  `hasFlatProlongationAt_of_dvr_package` equips `𝒪ᵥ`/`Kᵥ` with
  `ℤ_(q)`-algebra structures via `localizationToAdicCompletionIntegers`
  (composed through `𝒪ᵥ` so the first tower is rfl). ALL audit to
  standard axioms; the two `IsFlatAt` glue nodes now rest ONLY on
  the content leaves. GOTCHAS: (a) `∃`-anonymous-constructor
  `refine` postpones dependent instance metavars — type-ascribe
  each instance component (`(inferInstance : HopfAlgebra …)`); (b)
  structure-literal fields with `?_` lose their lambda binders —
  inline `by` blocks instead; (c) at `K := ℚ` the instance search
  for `Algebra ℚ Kᵥ` returns `DivisionRing.toRatAlgebra`, NOT the
  canonical `instAlgebraAdicCompletion` baked into general-`K`
  statements — pin the canonical instance explicitly in `@`-form
  when constructing `IsScalarTower Loc ℚ Kᵥ`; (d) `[Algebra K B]` +
  `[Bialgebra K B]` binders together create an `SMul` diamond that
  BREAKS `WithConv` instance synthesis — take only `[Bialgebra K B]`.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **BOTH TORSION-COUNT NODES DERIVED from six
  sharp division-polynomial leaves** (`TorsionCard.lean`; frontier
  count 19 → 23, strictly shallower — every remaining leaf is a
  concrete polynomial identity or a single Washington-Thm-3.6-style
  point formula). `smul_surjective` DERIVED from [the fibre-point node
  `exists_point_x_smul` + the `x([n]P)` formula node
  `exists_smul_some_eq` + `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` (Bézout, resultant branch)
  + `Y_eq_of_X_eq`/negation]. `prime_torsion_card` DERIVED from [the
  dictionary node `smul_some_eq_zero_iff` + `separable_preΨ'` +
  `isCoprime_Ψ₂Sq_preΨ'` + `separable_Ψ₂Sq`] via a shared counting
  skeleton: nonzero torsion = biUnion over roots of the cutting
  polynomial of the `y`-fibre finsets (`pointsAt`); PROVEN
  infrastructure includes the characteristic-free discriminant
  identity `(∂yQuad)² - 4·yQuad = C (Ψ₂Sq x₀)` and the explicit-Bézout
  separability `yQuad_separable` (audits clean). NOTE mathlib's
  division polynomials have NO point-level theory (the `zsmul` formula
  is `sorry` even in Angdinata's public mathlib branch
  `EllipticCurve.Torsion`; his torsion/Tate-module work with Wu and Xu
  is unpublished WIP) — the six leaves are exactly the missing
  arithmetic. GOTCHAS: `Polynomial.mem_roots'` for the unprimed-
  hypothesis form; `Set.ncard_coe_finset` (lowercase); `Nat.card_coe_
  set_eq` is root-namespace; `subst` on `hx : x' = ξ` eliminates the
  WRONG variable when both sides are locals (use an explicit
  coordinate-equality helper `hpoint` instead); `nomatch hP` for
  constructor-distinct `Point` equalities (`noConfusion` has universe
  trouble); `(0 : Point) = Point.zero` needs an explicit `show`/`rw`
  before `nomatch`; the `∃`-form fibre nodes avoid needing the `ω`
  division polynomial entirely (not yet defined in mathlib).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, division-polynomial attack map): the three
  remaining point-level nodes (`smul_some_eq_zero_iff`,
  `exists_smul_some_eq`, `exists_point_x_smul`) and `separable_preΨ'`
  are Washington *Elliptic Curves* Thm 3.6 territory. Mapped attack
  for the dictionary + formula nodes: simultaneous strong induction on
  `n` proving `x([n]P)·ψ_n²(x,y) = φ_n(x,y)` AND the `y`-coordinate
  tracked VALUE-wise (define `ωval n P := y(n•P)` on points, avoiding
  the `ω` polynomial mathlib lacks), with the inductive steps
  `[n+1]P = [n]P + P` and `[2n]P = 2·[n]P` computed by mathlib's
  `Affine.slope`/`addX`/`some_add_some` formula API and the EDS
  recurrences `preΨ'_even/odd` (`Mathlib.NumberTheory.
  EllipticDivisibilitySequence` + `DivisionPolynomial.Basic`
  recursion lemmas); each case is a curve-relation polynomial
  identity dischargeable by `linear_combination (norm := ring1)`
  against `equation_iff` after denominator clearing (the nonvanishing
  `ψ_n(x,y) ≠ 0` is exactly the dictionary's other direction, so the
  induction must prove the dictionary and the formula TOGETHER).
  `separable_preΨ'` afterwards via the disc-companion resultant
  identity (same family as `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` — Ayad, Manuscripta
  Math. 76). NOTE the annas-mcp server is not connected in this
  session; Washington/Silverman PDFs are not in `Books/` yet —
  download them when the MCP is available (the argument structure
  above is standard and self-contained to formalize regardless).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, Thm 3.6 state): `zsmul_some_aux` is the ✗○
  frontier node; BOTH base cases are PROVEN (`zsmul_some_aux_one`,
  `two_smul_some_eq_zero_iff`) and the consumers (dictionary +
  formula) are DERIVED. Pinned API for the step cases: mathlib
  `Affine.Point.add_some (hxy : ¬(x₁ = x₂ ∧ y₁ = negY x₂ y₂)) :
  some h₁ + some h₂ = some (nonsingular_add h₁ h₂ hxy)` with
  coordinates `addX x₁ x₂ (slope x₁ x₂ y₁ y₂)` / `addY`;
  `add_of_Y_eq` for the cancellation case; the `ψ`-recurrences via
  `normEDS` (`Mathlib.NumberTheory.EllipticDivisibilitySequence`) and
  `Ψ_even/Ψ_odd/preΨ_even/preΨ_odd` in `DivisionPolynomial.Basic`;
  evaluation bridges vendored in `Fermat/FLT/Mathlib/.../
  DivisionPolynomial/Points.lean`. The step `[n+1]P = [n]P + P` needs
  the x-addition identity `addX(x, x', λ)·ψ_{n+1}² = φ_{n+1}` given
  the IH identities at `n` (and `n-1` for the slope elimination) —
  the giant `linear_combination` against the curve equation; the
  step `[2n]P = 2·[n]P` needs the duplication identity. These two
  identities are the remaining mountain; everything else is plumbing.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, Thm 3.6 ingredients COMPLETE): everything the
  `zsmul_some_aux` step cases consume is now PROVEN and audits clean:
  `evalEval_φ_eq` (`φₙ = x·ψₙ² − ψₙ₊₁ψₙ₋₁` on the curve — equivalently
  `x − x([n]P) = ψₙ₊₁ψₙ₋₁/ψₙ²`, the difference form), `evalEval_ψ_even`
  (`ψ₂ₘ·ψ₂ = ψₘ₋₁²ψₘψₘ₊₂ − ψₘ₋₂ψₘψₘ₊₁²`), `evalEval_ψ_odd`
  (`ψ₂ₘ₊₁ = ψₘ₊₂ψₘ³ − ψₘ₋₁ψₘ₊₁³`; the `Ψ_odd` correction dies on
  points since it carries `W.polynomial` as a factor), the base cases
  `zsmul_some_aux_one` and `two_smul_some_eq_zero_iff`, and the
  vendored evaluation bridges. What remains inside the node is the
  strong-induction assembly: cases `[n+1]P = [n]P + P` and
  `[2n]P = 2·[n]P` via `Affine.Point.add_some`/`add_of_Y_eq`, where
  the coordinate identities reduce, after `field_simp`, to
  `linear_combination`s of the curve equations of `(x,y)`/`(x',y')`,
  the IH identities, and the two on-curve recurrences above. GOTCHA:
  `Polynomial.evalEval_mul/sub/add/pow` are the working simp set for
  pushing `evalEval` through `Ψ`-identities (the
  `coe_evalEvalRingHom`+`map_*` route stalls).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE DUPLICATION FORMULA IS PROVEN**
  (`zsmul_some_aux_two`, characteristic-free, no `(2:k) ≠ 0` needed):
  for `ψ₂(x,y) ≠ 0`, `2•P` is affine with `x'·ψ₂² = φ₂(x,y)` and
  `(2y'+a₁x'+a₃)·ψ₂⁴ = ψ₄(x,y)`. METHOD (now validated, use for the
  remaining step cases): (1) NO field_simp — work with the multiplied
  slope equation `hT : ℓ·ψ₂v = 3x²+2a₂x+a₄−a₁y` (from
  `div_mul_cancel₀`); (2) the goal's `λ`-powers are eliminated by a
  hand-computed `linear_combination` coefficient on `hT` (telescoping
  `(λd)^k − T^k` factors); (3) the remaining curve-equation multiplier
  is computed EXACTLY by sympy polynomial division of the λ-free
  residual by `g = y² + a₁xy + a₃y − (x³+a₂x²+a₄x+a₆)` in `y`
  (remainder verified 0) and pasted as the `heq`-coefficient. sympy is
  now installed (`pip3 install --break-system-packages --user sympy`).
  Model file pattern in the proof of `zsmul_some_aux_two`. Remaining
  inside the ✗○ node `zsmul_some_aux`: the two-point addition step
  (secant slope, same certificate workflow against the IH identities —
  ideal membership via sympy Groebner if plain division does not
  suffice) and the strong-induction assembly.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, `zsmul_some_aux` assembly design COMPLETE —
  numerically validated): the induction proceeds on the tracked pair
  ((i) `xₙψₙ² = φₙ`, (ii) `tₙψₙ⁴ = ψ₂ₙ` with `tₙ` the `ψ₂`-value at
  `n•P`), steps `[2m+1]P = [m+1]P + [m]P` and `[2m]P = [m+1]P +
  [m-1]P` (NOT duplication — compositions like `Ψ₃(xₘ)` would intrude).
  PROVEN inputs: the secant denominators are exactly `x_sub_gap_one`
  (`(xₘ₊₁−xₘ)(ψₘψₘ₊₁)² = −ψ₂ₘ₊₁`) and `x_sub_gap_two`
  (`(xₘ₋₁−xₘ₊₁)(ψₘ₋₁ψₘ₊₁)² = ψ₂ₘψ₂`), both derived from
  `evalEval_φ_eq` + the on-curve recurrences; the collision branches
  divert through `smul_collision`/`eq_or_add_eq_zero_of_X_eq` to the
  dictionary side; `add_some_coords` gives the sum's coordinates in
  multiplied form; the `y`-differences come from the trackings via
  `2(yᵢ−yⱼ) = (tᵢ−tⱼ) − a₁(xᵢ−xⱼ)` — THE ONLY place `(2:k) ≠ 0`
  enters (thread it through `zsmul_some_aux` and consumers when
  assembling; the FLT pipeline consumes torsion counts at char 0
  only). REMAINING (one focused session): per-step certificates in the
  window variables `ψₘ₋₂..ψₘ₊₃` — the targets' double-index values
  (`φ₂ₘ₊₁`, `ψ₂ₘ`, `ψ₄ₘ₊₂`, …) reduce to the window through the
  recurrences, but the recurrence instances are PARITY-SPECIFIC, so
  the assembly needs the classical four-fold case split (`n = 2m`,
  `2m+1` with `m` even/odd) with per-case sympy-computed
  `linear_combination` certificates (Groebner/ideal-membership against
  the curve equation, the IH relations, and the parity-instantiated
  recurrences; the validated workflow and a worked model are in the
  proofs of `zsmul_some_aux_two` and the gap lemmas). Boundary values
  `ψ₀ = 0`, `ψ₁ = 1`, `ψ₋₁ = −1` are inline-available from mathlib
  (`ψ_zero`/`ψ_one`/`ψ_neg`) for the small-`m` instantiations.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, odd-step certificate structure): the odd-step
  `x`-target IS numerically true in the free-window model, and the
  certificate ideal needs THREE generator families: (a) the curve
  equation `g(x,y)`, (b) the two Ward gap-2 bindings
  `ψₘ₊₂ψₘ₋₂ = ψₘ₊₁ψₘ₋₁ψ₂² − Ψ₃ψₘ²` (at `m` and `m+1` — these bind the
  outer window symbols; carried as component (iii) of the simultaneous
  induction package since mathlib's Ward relation for `normEDS` is an
  open TODO; base instances `j = 2, 3` are trivial), and (c) the IH
  points' own curve-membership — in the free-window sympy model this
  is the cleared `tⱼ² = Ψ₂Sq(xⱼ)` compatibility, but in the LEAN
  assembly it comes free as `heqₘ : Equation xₘ yₘ` from the IH's
  `Nonsingular` data (use the points' equations directly as
  `linear_combination` inputs rather than the eliminated form).
  Groebner verification of the closure running; the same structure
  applies to the even step `[2m] = [m+1] + [m−1]` with gap-2 as the
  secant denominator.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, `zsmul_some_aux` — THE PACKAGE IS
  STRUCTURALLY COMPLETE): the odd-step x-target's residual over
  (curve equation, IH memberships) factors EXACTLY as
  `W²((b₂+12x)ψₙ²ψₙ₊₁² − 4(ψₙ₋₁ψₙ₊₁³+ψₙ³ψₙ₊₂)) − (ψₙψₙ₊₁)⁶(tₙ+tₙ₊₁)²`
  — the missing information is the CROSS-TERM `tₙtₙ₊₁` (the relative
  sign of consecutive trackings, which memberships alone cannot fix).
  The induction package therefore carries THREE components:
  (i) `xₙψₙ² = φₙ`; (ii) `tₙψₙ⁴ = ψ₂ₙ`; (iii) the cross-tracking
  `2tₙtₙ₊₁(ψₙψₙ₊₁)⁶ = ψ₂ₙ₊₁²((b₂+12x)ψₙ²ψₙ₊₁² − 4(ψₙ₋₁ψₙ₊₁³+ψₙ³ψₙ₊₂))
  − (ψₙψₙ₊₁)⁶(Ψ₂Sq(xₙ)+Ψ₂Sq(xₙ₊₁))` — window-expressible, numerically
  validated for n = 2..5 (validator in the certificate script). With
  (iii) as an ideal generator the odd-step x-target closes by
  construction; (iii) also supersedes the earlier Ward-gap-2 plan
  (Z, E eliminate via the trackings with only ψₙ, ψₙ₊₁ ≠ 0
  denominators). Remaining: certify the propagation of (i)+(ii)+(iii)
  through both steps with the script (mechanical), then write the
  Lean skeleton.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, odd-step x-certificate EXACT): with (iii) and
  the two memberships as hypotheses, the odd-step x-target closes with
  UNIT COFACTORS — `num + 1·(iii) + ψₙ₊₁⁶·(membership at n) +
  ψₙ⁶·(membership at n+1) = 0` IDENTICALLY (not even the curve
  equation is needed at this level; verified symbolically, validator
  `certificate_odd_step_x` in the script). The Lean certificate is a
  three-term `linear_combination`; the memberships come from the IH
  points' `Nonsingular` data via the proven on-curve pattern
  `Ψ₂Sq(xⱼ) = tⱼ²` (the `hΨval` computation in
  `two_smul_some_eq_zero_iff` — extract it as a standalone lemma when
  assembling). Remaining certificates to compute with the script: the
  odd-step t-target, the (iii)-propagation to the output pairs, and
  the even-step analogues — then the skeleton.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, degenerate branch closed): the induction's
  outermost split is on `s := ψ₂(x,y)`. If `s = 0` (`P` is
  2-torsion): even-index `ψ`-values vanish identically (the `ψ₂`
  factor), `n•P` alternates `0, P`, and (i)/(ii) hold trivially ONCE
  odd-index `ψ`-values are known nonzero there — which follows by the
  odd recurrence (at `s = 0` it degenerates to a product of two
  smaller odd-index values) seeded by **`Res(Ψ₂Sq, Ψ₃) = −Δ²`
  EXACTLY** (sympy-verified, validator in the script): 2-torsion and
  3-torsion `x`-coordinates are disjoint on an elliptic curve in
  every characteristic. Lean-side this resultant is a concrete
  identity in `a₁..a₆` (7×7 Sylvester determinant — provable once by
  computation, then `exists_mul_add_mul_eq_C_resultant` gives the
  Bézout as in `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`). If `s ≠ 0`: the generic two-secant
  machinery with the `s`-divided even-recurrence eliminations is
  fully legal.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **BOTH step x-targets close with unit
  cofactors.** The even-step residual over (memberships at m−1, m+1)
  has t-part `−(ψₘ₋₁ψₘ₊₁)⁶(tₘ₊₁−tₘ₋₁)²`, giving the gap-2
  cross-relation (iii₂) (pair (m−1, m+1); only t-monomial
  `−2(ψₘ₋₁ψₘ₊₁)⁶tₘ₋₁tₘ₊₁`) with closure BY CONSTRUCTION:
  `num + (iii₂) + ψₘ₊₁⁶·cmₘ₋₁ + ψₘ₋₁⁶·cmₘ₊₁ = 0`; (iii₂) numerically
  validated m = 2..5 (validator `certificate_even_step_x`). The
  induction package therefore carries cross-tracking at BOTH pair
  gaps: (iii-a) consecutive `(n, n+1)`, (iii-b) gap-2 `(n−1, n+1)`.
  Certificate inventory remaining: the two t-target closures
  (odd-step check running with specialized coefficients) and the
  propagation of (iii-a)/(iii-b) to the output pairs — then the Lean
  skeleton.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, odd t-target status): the deterministic
  elimination chain (tⱼ² → memberships, tₘtₘ₊₁ → (iii-a)) reduces the
  odd-step t-target to a t-LINEAR residue whose coefficients do NOT
  vanish mod the curve equation alone (78/78/195 terms) — the t-target
  needs additional t-linear generators beyond (memberships, iii-a):
  candidates are the s-coupled cross-instances (pairs `(1, m)`,
  `(1, m+1)`; note `t₁ = s`, `ψ₁ = 1`) — the general-pair
  cross-tracking family evaluated at gap `m∓1`... derive the exact
  shape by the same residual read-off next (extract the 78-term
  t-linear coefficient, identify it against `s·(window)`-multiples).
  Lean-side: `eval_Ψ₂Sq_eq_sq` (the membership identity) extracted as
  a standalone lemma; `two_smul_some_eq_zero_iff` refactored onto it.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE UNIVERSAL TWO-POINT CROSS IDENTITY IS
  PROVEN IN LEAN** (`two_point_cross_identity`, cofactors −4/−4 on
  the two curve equations): `2t₁t₂(x₁−x₂)² = (b₂+4x₁+4x₂)(x₁−x₂)⁴ +
  4X₃ − (Ψ₂Sq(x₁)+Ψ₂Sq(x₂))(x₁−x₂)²` with `X₃` the multiplied secant
  `x`-form of `Q₁−Q₂`. Numerically verified to subsume ALL
  cross-tracking instances (pairs `(n,n+1)`: difference `P`;
  `(m−1,m+1)`: difference `2P`; `(1,m)`: difference `(m−1)P`) — so
  the induction package collapses back to (i) + (ii), and the
  t-linear generators the odd t-target needed are the `(1,·)`
  instances of THIS lemma (the difference x-coordinates are IH-known).
  Remaining before the skeleton: recompute the t-target closures with
  the universal-identity instances as generators (mechanical), and
  the step-output tracking derivations.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **`zsmul_some_aux` SIMPLIFIED — the tracking
  conjunct is GONE.** The `(1, j)`-instances of the proven
  `two_point_cross_identity` solve for the `ψ₂`-values
  `tⱼ = 2yⱼ + a₁xⱼ + a₃` in closed form (`tⱼ·ψⱼ³·s` = an explicit
  window expression; sympy-derived), so the induction carries ONLY the
  `x`-formula — the node's `∃` shrank to
  `n•P = some x' y' ∧ x'ψₙ² = φₙ`, consumers unchanged (they never
  used the tracking), downstream builds clean. The t-target
  certificate obligation CEASES TO EXIST; the induction steps pin all
  `y`-data through the universal identity and the two proven
  x-certificates close with unit cofactors. Remaining for the node:
  the strong-induction skeleton itself (case bookkeeping: parity,
  collisions via `smul_collision`, the `s = 0` branch via the
  `Res(Ψ₂Sq, Ψ₃) = -Δ²` seed, and the base cases — all staged).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE GENERIC ODD STEP IS PROVEN IN LEAN**
  (`zsmul_odd_step_x`, audits clean, characteristic-free): from IH
  data at `m`, `m+1` (points via `heqm`/`heqm1`, x-formulas,
  trackings) with `xₘ₊₁ ≠ xₘ`, the point `(2m+1)•P` is affine with
  the x-formula. KEY DISCOVERY: the core `(x−x₃)dx² = t₁t₂` is a PURE
  RING identity from the two secant identities (sum and difference
  additions) — `linear_combination hX₄' − hX₃` — the universal
  identity and memberships DROP OUT of the x-side entirely (sympy
  cofactor-solve: c₂ = c₄ = c₅ = 0). The conversion layer:
  `evalEval_φ_eq` at `2m+1` + `x_sub_gap_one` + the congr-multiplied
  tracking product. REMAINING in the node: the even-step analogue
  (same shape with gap-2), the per-step TRACKING OUTPUT (the
  `t₃`-derivation — the internal (ii) at the new index, consumed by
  later steps), the collision/degenerate branches (all staged), and
  the skeleton wiring.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5): **THE CONSECUTIVE STEP IS PROVEN
  (`zsmul_consec_step_x`) — parity-free, superseding the odd/even
  split.** `[n]P = [n-1]P + P` with difference `[n-2]P`; the ring core
  `(x₂−x₃)dx² = t₁s` from the two secants; the conversion
  `φₙψₙ₋₂² = φₙ₋₂ψₙ² − sψ₂ₙ₋₂` DERIVED from `evalEval_φ_eq` (at n,
  n−1, n−2) + `evalEval_ψ_even` (at n−1) + `evalEval_ψ_two`,
  assembled as two small linear_combinations and a `ψₙ₋₂²`-
  cancellation. IH inputs: points + x-formulas at n−1, n−2, tracking
  at n−1 only. REMAINING in the node: the per-step TRACKING OUTPUT
  (tₙ at the new index — the last open certificate), the collision
  and `s = 0` branches (staged), the base cases (proven), and the
  strong-induction wiring.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5, tracking-output design): the per-step
  tracking `tₙψₙ⁴ = ψ₂ₙ` reduces to the ψ-window identity (★s):
  `ψₙ₋₁²ψₙ₊₂ + ψₙ₋₂ψₙ₊₁² = ψₙ₋₁ψₙψₙ₊₁(6x²+b₂x+b₄) − ψₙ³Ψ₂Sq(x)` on
  the curve — the SUM-companion of the even recurrence (numerically
  V = 0; it was exactly the residue of the tracking-output reduction).
  At the point level it is the symmetric addition identity
  `sum_diff_X_identity` (NOW PROVEN, cofactors −2/−2) composed with
  φ-difference eliminations — but the φ-eliminations return (★s)
  circularly, so (★s) needs a POLYNOMIAL-level proof by the mathlib
  `Ψ_even`/`Ψ_odd` technique (parity split on `n`, `preΨ'`
  recursions, `C_simp; ring1`) — same family, mathlib-PR-shaped.
  PLAN: state `evalEval_ψ_sum` (★s) as a sharp sorry node (replacing
  the remaining interior of `zsmul_some_aux` together with the
  staged pieces), derive the tracking output from it +
  `sum_diff_X_identity` + the universal identity, then wire the
  skeleton. The Thm 3.6 node then rests on: (★s) + the fibre node +
  `separable_preΨ'` + `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` — all pure
  division-polynomial statements.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont.): TRACKING OUTPUT CLOSED (`ad9e21a`).
  The plan of the previous entry is executed: (★s) is stated as the
  sharp sorry node `evalEval_ψ_sum`; the pure two-point residue turned
  out even cleaner than projected — the chain [(★s) with cofactor ψₙ,
  gap-1 at n scaled by ψₙ₋₁², gap-1 at n-1] collapses the s-multiplied
  tracking target (t₃ψₙ⁴ - ψ₂ₙ)·s·ψₙ₋₁² to ψₙ⁴ψₙ₋₁²·T₄ where T₄ is the
  ψ-free TRACE IDENTITY s(t₃+s) = (x-x₃)(6x²+b₂x+b₄) - 2(x-x₁)(x-x₃)²
  (x₃,t₃ the secant sum-expressions, x₁ the difference x-coordinate =
  IH point). T₄ = `two_point_trace_identity`, PROVEN: clear (x₁-x₂)⁵,
  eliminate t₃ by the ψ₂-secant (cofactor s(x₁-x₂)⁴) and x₃ by the
  x-secant (binomial bookkeeping), reduce by the two curve equations
  (sympy `sp.div` chain; certificate one-shot in Lean). NO tracking
  hypothesis at n-2, NO ψₙ₋₃, NO x₂-pinning needed — the sign
  propagates purely through the y-addition formula. `eval_Ψ₂Sq_eq_sq`
  relocated with a direct cofactor `-4` proof (yQuad-free).
  `zsmul_consec_step` (renamed from `_x`) now outputs the FULL IH
  package; new hypotheses `ψₙ₋₁ ≠ 0`, `ψ₂(x,y) ≠ 0` (both available in
  the main branch: IH(a)-contrapositive resp. the s ≠ 0 branch guard).
  Axioms: `two_point_trace_identity`, `eval_Ψ₂Sq_eq_sq` clean;
  `zsmul_consec_step` inherits sorryAx exactly through (★s).
  NEXT: (1) attempt (★s) at the Ψ-polynomial level (parity split on n,
  `Ψ_even`/`Ψ_odd`-style: 4 parity cases, preΨ'-recursion instances,
  `C_simp; ring1`); (2) wire the `zsmul_some_aux` strong-induction
  skeleton: ℕ-reduction `⟨(n-1).toNat, by omega⟩` + strong induction,
  base cases 1/2, main branch via `zsmul_consec_step` + collision via
  `smul_collision` + dictionary, 2-torsion branch s = 0 (even-index ψ
  vanish at 2-torsion x, odd-index don't — seeded by
  Res(Ψ₂Sq, Ψ₃) = -Δ², to be phrased via
  `exists_mul_add_mul_eq_C_resultant`).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., (★s) ROUTE DISCOVERED — universal EDS):
  (★s) is EQUIVALENT (per unit ψ₂Ψ₃, via the anchor identity
  `Ψ₃(6x²+b₂x+b₄) = preΨ₄ + Ψ₂Sq²` [ring-verified] and `Ψ₂Sq = ψ₂²`
  on-curve) to the UNIVERSAL EDS identity (★s′):
  `bc(Wₙ₋₁²Wₙ₊₂ + Wₙ₋₂Wₙ₊₁²) = Wₙ₋₁WₙWₙ₊₁(db + b⁵) − Wₙ³b³c` for
  `W = normEDS b c d` — verified numerically for generic (b,c,d), so
  provable from the defining recursions alone with NO curve geometry.
  Deduction chain: (★s′) in ℤ[A₁..A₆]-coordinate ring (a DOMAIN where
  ψ₂ ≠ 0, Ψ₃ ≠ 0) ⟹ cancel ⟹ (★s) universally ⟹ specialize to any
  (E, k, x, y). Descent experiments (scripts/eds/, sympy Groebner over
  window symbols, specialized b,c,d): the parity descents of the fixed
  families CLOSE — F_odd over F-instances alone (SYMBOLIC certificate
  extracted, certs.pkl), F_even over {F, ES2±3, ES3±2, ES4±1, ES5},
  ES2/ES3/ES4 even+odd all close, ES5_odd open (needs ES6-ish).
  STRUCTURAL REDUCTION: the general elliptic-sequence relator
  `rel(p,q,r,0)` follows RING-TRIVIALLY (alternating 3×3 expansion) 
  from the two-parameter family
  `T(p,q): W(p+q)W(p−q) = W(p+1)W(p−1)W(q)² − W(q+1)W(q−1)W(p)²`,
  so the right theorem is STANGE'S THEOREM for normEDS (a declared
  mathlib TODO: `IsEllipticSequence (normEDS b c d)`): prove T(p,q) by
  double parity descent over 4 clusters {W(a+j), W(e+j), W(a+e+j),
  W(a−e+j)}, |j| ≤ 2 — 4 fixed-size certificates; then ES-k = T(·,k),
  then F(n) descends over T-instances, then (★s′) ⟹ (★s) ⟹ tracking.
  Even-even T-descent Groebner test running. NEXT: (1) finish the 4
  T-descent membership tests + extract certificates; (2) Lean file
  Fermat/FLT/Mathlib/NumberTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean:
  T(p,q) by strong induction (base |p|,|q| small via normEDS_zero..four
  + recursions; step via the 4 certificates), rel(p,q,r,0) trivially,
  F(n) by its descent, (★s′); (3) coordinate-ring domain argument +
  specialization ⟹ close `evalEval_ψ_sum`; (4) the zsmul skeleton
  (design DONE, in the log above): generic branch via zsmul_consec_step
  + IH-iff; collision via smul_collision + gap-1; torsion sub-cases via
  the Ward-pattern node `psi_nonzero_of_not_dvd` (N2, subsumes the
  s = 0 branch at d = 2 with the Res(Ψ₂Sq,Ψ₃) = −Δ² seed) + degenerate-
  window certificates (universal-ideal members with Wₙ₋₁ resp. Wₙ₋₂ as
  extra generators — same machinery).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., Ward pattern wired `b5e9887`): the
  rigidity insight — `ψⱼ = ψⱼ₊₁ = 0` forces `φⱼ(x) = 0` (φ-difference
  identity), a common root of `Φ j`/`ΨSq j` against the Bézout node —
  makes adjacent-nonvanishing FREE. `psi_eq_zero_iff_dvd` is now WIRED:
  backward from the new universal divisibility node
  `normEDS_mul_complEDS` (mathlib-TODO-shaped; even case already in
  mathlib), forward by the T(m−d, d)-climb (c_d ≠ 0 from minimality +
  rigidity). New DERIVED bridges: `evalEval_ψ_normEDS` (ψ-values ARE a
  normEDS — universal identities specialise pointwise with no curve
  input), `evalEval_ψ_T`, `evalEval_ψ_quadratic`. The remaining
  frontier below `n_torsion_card` is now EXACTLY: three universal EDS
  nodes (`normEDS_sum_companion` (★s′), `normEDS_ellSequence` (Stange
  T-family), `normEDS_mul_complEDS` (divisibility)) + two degenerate
  tracking certificates (C1/C2, provable from the universal nodes +
  the c₃ = 0 torsion sub-case) + `separable_preΨ'` +
  `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` + `exists_point_x_smul` + `smul_surjective`.
  T-descent Groebner experiments still running (plain 9-generator and
  cross-generator variants).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., (★s′) CLOSED `837d2c7`): the literature
  hunt paid off — van der Poorten–Swart ("every Somos 4 is a Somos k",
  arXiv math/0412293) is the certificate-light proof: their Prop 1(4)
  IS the `T(·,2)` family and Prop 1(5) IS (★s′), with the footnote
  telescope deriving (5) from (4). Executed in Lean, all sorry-free:
  ES2-only parity-descent certificates (found by multivariate division
  after the key discovery that ES2 SELF-descends), generic-domain
  cancellations powered by `normEDS_generic_ne_zero` (witnessed by the
  universal curve through mk_Ψ ≠ 0), telescope + antisymmetry induction.
  AXIOM-CLEAN: `normEDS_quadratic`, `normEDS_sum_companion`,
  `evalEval_ψ_sum`, `zsmul_consec_step`. Remaining EDS frontier:
  `normEDS_ellSequence` (general T(p,q) — Stange/Ward; plan: vdP–Swart
  Thm 3 double-family induction (T and the s=1 net family N) from
  Prop 1(4)+(5) both now PROVEN, per-step certificates with generic
  cancellation) + the degenerate tracking certificates C1/C2 (crux
  ideal-membership verified; c₃-cancellation via the same generic
  route or the d=3 pattern).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., STANGE'S THEOREM PROVEN `7b1c6be`):
  `normEDS_ellSequence` — the full two-parameter elliptic-sequence
  relation `T(p,q)` for `normEDS` over any ring (mathlib TODO) — is
  sorry-free. Key discovery: the vdP–Swart inductive step is a RANK-1
  product identity `S₁T₋₁·S₋₁T₁ = S₁T₁·S₋₁T₋₁` (ring-trivial), whose
  residual is their symmetry identity (15) with the tiny hand-derived
  certificate `bc·K = bcU₀²V₀⁴·ES2ᵤ − U₀V₀²V₋₁V₁·★ᵤ − (u↔v)` over the
  PROVEN `T(·,2)` + sum-companion families. The universal EDS layer is
  now COMPLETE and axiom-clean: `normEDS_quadratic`,
  `normEDS_sum_companion`, `normEDS_ellSequence`,
  `normEDS_mul_complEDS`, `normEDS_generic_ne_zero`. Downstream now
  axiom-clean: `evalEval_ψ_sum`, `evalEval_ψ_T`, `evalEval_ψ_quadratic`,
  `zsmul_consec_step`. `psi_eq_zero_iff_dvd` rests ONLY on
  `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`; `zsmul_some_aux` additionally on
  `psi_tracking_prev_zero`/`_prev2_zero` (C1/C2). NEXT: (1) C1/C2 via
  the generic-cancellation route (crux certificate in the fraction
  field verified; c₃-cancellation generic; the value-level c₃ = 0
  subcase via the d = 3 Ward pattern + `normEDS b 0 d` closed forms);
  (2) `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` (7×7-Sylvester-flavoured, or the
  Δ-formula route); (3) `exists_point_x_smul`, `separable_preΨ'`,
  `smul_surjective`; then the WeilPairing/Chebotarev/hardly-ramified
  branches.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., C1/C2 PROVEN `cc90dfb`): both degenerate
  tracking certificates are sorry-free via the complement sequence +
  the crux lemmas `normEDS_crux₁/₂` (one-line consequences of the
  sum-companion/T(·,2) families; multiples of ψₙ₋₁ resp. ψₙ₋₂) for
  `Ψ₃(x) ≠ 0`, and via the anchor (`preΨ₄(x) = -ψ₂⁴`) + the d = 3 Ward
  pattern + the 3-division closed forms for `Ψ₃(x) = 0`. THE ENTIRE
  WASHINGTON THM 3.6 TOWER (zsmul_some_aux, the dictionary,
  smul_some_eq_zero_iff, exists_smul_some_eq) now rests on EXACTLY ONE
  sorry: `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` (via isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq → psi_adjacent_ne_zero
  → the Ward pattern's rigidity). Analysis: the rigidity is genuinely
  y-geometric (pure-T zero-propagation cannot reach index 1), so the
  Φ/ΨSq-coprimality is load-bearing; options: (a) prove the resultant
  formula by recursion-multiplicativity (Ayad-style), (b) restate the
  node as field-level `IsCoprime` and prove by induction on division
  polynomials, (c) universal-curve + Δ-irreducibility + Nullstellensatz.
  Remaining cone of `n_torsion_card`: resultant_Φ_ΨSq,
  separable_preΨ', exists_point_x_smul, smul_surjective.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 cont., fibre node PROVEN `cf0cb95`): 
  `exists_root_of_derivative_ne_zero` (general: nonzero derivative ⟹
  root over a separably closed field; expand-factorization argument)
  and `exists_point_x_smul` (the fibre polynomial `Φₙ − ξΨSqₙ` has
  derivative with `(n²−1)`-st coefficient `n² ≠ 0`; y-lifting via the
  separable y-quadratic, the char ≠ 2 double root, or the char-2
  `Φ`-definition collapse forcing `ξ = x₀`). `smul_surjective` is now
  DERIVED end-to-end. The `n_torsion_card` cone rests on exactly TWO
  sorries: `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` (rigidity/coprimality) and
  `separable_preΨ'` (the p-division discriminant) — the
  resultant/discriminant cluster for division polynomials.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 end, Wronskian lead for `separable_preΨ'`):
  empirically `Φₙ'ΨSqₙ − ΦₙΨSqₙ' = n ⬝ Wₙ` with `W₂ = 2·preΨ₄`
  (verified exactly) and `W₃ = 3·Ψ₃·(preΨ'₅ − preΨ₄²)` where
  `preΨ'₅ := preΨ₄Ψ₂Sq² − Ψ₃³` (verified exactly): the deg-12 factor
  is the 5-division polynomial CORRECTED by `−preΨ₄²` — the pattern
  suggests `Wₙ = n·(the univariate ψ₂ₙ/ψ₂-companion in its parity
  normalization)`, i.e. the invariant-differential identity
  `d(x∘[n])/dx = n·(ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ⁴)·(ψ₂-quotient)` cleared of denominators.
  This is the invariant-differential/ramification identity; from it,
  a common root of `preΨ'ₚ` and its derivative forces division-
  polynomial vanishing patterns that should contradict the Bézout
  machinery — the route to `separable_preΨ'` WITHOUT the full
  discriminant formula. VERIFIED (scripts/eds/wronskian_composition.py):
  (W) `Φₙ'ΨSqₙ − ΦₙΨSqₙ' = n·preΨ(2n)` at n = 2, 3, 4, and
  (C) `Φ(2n) = Φ₂hom(Φₙ,ΨSqₙ)`, `ΨSq(2n) = Ψ₂Sqhom(Φₙ,ΨSqₙ)` at n = 2
  (the duplication-composition pair, EXACT, no unit). SEPARABILITY
  PROOF SHAPE: double root x₀ of preΨ'ₚ ⟹ ΨSqₚ-mult ≥ 4 ⟹ (W)
  preΨ(2p)-mult ≥ 3 ⟹ ΨSq(2p)-mult ≥ 6; but (C) + Bézout (Φₚ(x₀) ≠ 0)
  give ΨSq(2p)-mult exactly 4 at x₀ (char ≠ 2 via the 4Φ³-term;
  char 2 needs its own composition trick). PROOF ROUTES: (C) should be
  a T-family window-certificate (φ-diff expansions); (W) by parity
  induction with DIFFERENTIATED recursions over the joint {P, P'}
  window (same descent machinery, one derivative level up), or via the
  chain rule through (C) (the Jacobian of the pair is 2·preΨ₄hom).
  KEY SIMPLIFICATION: at the value level (C)'s ΨSq-side is literally
  tracking² + membership-at-nP: `ψ₂ₙ² = tₙ²ψₙ⁸ = Ψ₂Sq(xₙ)ψₙ⁸ =
  Ψ₂Sqhom(φₙ, ψₙ²)`, and the Φ-side is the x-formula composed with
  duplication (`x₂ₙ = x₂(xₙ)`) — both from the PROVEN zsmul-machinery
  instantiated at the TAUTOLOGICAL POINT of the universal curve over
  Frac(B_univ) (ψₖ-values ≠ 0 there by mk_Ψ_univ_ne_zero), then pulled
  back to ℤ[A][x] by the {1,Y}-basis injectivity (both sides y-free).
  (W) at prime indices is NOT composition-reachable — needs the
  differentiated-recursion descent over the joint {P, P'} window.
  CONFIRMED FURTHER: the (C)-ΨSq-side CLOSES as a value-window ideal
  membership over {even-rec, T(n,2), star, membership, c/d-anchors,
  b₈-relation} (GB size 13, scripts/eds/composition_psisq_certificate
  .py) — but plain multivariate DIVISION fails in 500 generator
  orders, so no easy explicit cofactors: use the TAUTOLOGICAL-POINT
  route (where (C)-ΨSq is literally tracking² + membership-at-nP,
  zero new certificates). And the Euler-homogeneity chain rule gives the exact
  doubling law `W(2n) = 2·preΨ₄hom(Φₙ,ΨSqₙ)·W(n)` since the Jacobian
  of the composition pair is `8·preΨ₄hom` (verified). The remaining
  odd-index (W)-steps at primes need the differentiated-recursion
  descent OR the derivation-on-Frac(B) invariant-differential
  induction. MULTIPLICITY ENDGAME (worked out precisely, UFD-valuation
  form over k[x], no k̄): for an irreducible π ∣ gcd(preΨ'ₚ, (preΨ'ₚ)')
  with a := ν_π(preΨ'ₚ): in all cases ν_π(ΨSqₚ') ≥ 2 hence
  ν_π(W) ≥ min(2a, 2a−1) and ν_π(preΨ(2p)) ≥ 2a−1 ((p:k) ≠ 0); the
  ΨSq-composition gives 2(2a−1) + ν(Ψ₂Sq) = 2a + ν_π(H) with
  H := 4Φ³ + b₂Φ²ΨSq + 2b₄ΦΨSq² + b₆ΨSq³ ≡ 4Φ³ (mod π) and
  ν_π(H) = 0 by the Bézout node — contradiction for char ≠ 2. In
  char 2 with a₁ ≠ 0: H ≡ b₂Φ²ΨSq, same contradiction one level down.
  Char-2-supersingular (a₁ = 0, Ψ₂Sq = b₆ constant): the [2]-
  composition degenerates; use the [3]-composition (Ψ₃hom ≡ 3Φ⁴ and
  3 ≠ 0 in char 2) with the tripling law W(3n) = 3·(factor)·W(n) —
  needs the [3]-composition pair verified/certified.
  IMPORTANT: the endgame needs (W) AT p ITSELF, and primes ≥ 5 are
  not composition-reachable — so the doubling/tripling laws do NOT
  suffice; (W) requires either the differentiated-recursion descent
  over the joint {P, P'} window (the parity recursions differentiated,
  same GB machinery one derivative level up) or the derivation on
  Frac(B_univ) (D := ∂x − (Fx/Fy)∂y, differentiate the addition
  formula once — the invariant-differential additivity — then induct;
  ~200 lines with mathlib's Derivation API). The compositions (C) for
  m = 2, 3 formalize uniformly via the tautological point:
  x(m·(nP)) = Φₘ(xₙ)/ΨSqₘ(xₙ) is quotient-arithmetic of the PROVEN
  x-formulas, cross-multiplied and pulled back by basis-injectivity
  with exactness from the Degree API leading coefficients.
  NEXT SESSION: (1) formalize (C) (either route); (2) the (W)
  machinery (differentiated descent — REQUIRED for primes); (3) the
  multiplicity endgame as above;
  (2) `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` or its `IsCoprime` reformulation; then the
  torsion cone is DONE. Remaining 18 nodes list: see the sorry-grep;
  major fronts: WeilPairing:124, Chebotarev:98, HardlyRamified (5
  nodes), TateCurve (2), MazurTorsion (2), Semistable (2),
  GoodReduction, Flat:163 (torsion-flat construction).
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 end, tautological point built `de9784b`):
  `TautologicalPoint.lean` (all axiom-clean): `Kuniv = Frac(Buniv)`,
  the base-changed curve `WK`, `taut_equation`, `Δ_univ_ne_zero`
  (evaluate at `y² + y = x³`), `coeffHom_injective`,
  `taut_nonsingular`. The generic-point engine for (C) is ready: next
  session instantiates the PROVEN multiplication machinery
  (`exists_smul_some_eq`, trackings) at `(tautX, tautY)` over `Kuniv`
  — all division-polynomial values there are nonzero by
  `mk_Ψ_univ_ne_zero` pushed through the fraction field — derives the
  composition identities at values, pulls back to `ℤ[A][X]` via
  `coeffHom_injective`-style basis arguments, and then runs the
  UFD-multiplicity endgame for `separable_preΨ'`.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, WEIL PAIRING DECOMPOSED): the
  `exists_weilPairing` node is now DERIVED from the strictly smaller
  node `det_galoisRep_eq_cyclotomic` (det of the mod-p representation
  is the mod-p cyclotomic character). Assembly PROVEN: #E[p] = p²
  (card_torsionBy at the algebraic closure, now resultant-free) ⟹
  the torsion is a rank-2 ZMod-p-space (card_eq_pow_finrank +
  pow-injectivity) ⟹ the coordinate determinant form in a finBasis
  is alternating and nondegenerate, and transforms by det ρ
  (pairing_map_eq_det_smul, in-file), which is χ by the det-node.
  GOTCHA: do NOT `haveI Classical.decEq` over an existing project
  DecidableEq-instance — nTorsion carries the instance as a type
  argument and the ∃-type was elaborated with the ambient one.
  ROUTE FOR THE DET-NODE (sketch, fits existing tree nodes):
  det ρ̄ and χ̄ are characters G_ℚ → (ZMod p)ˣ; they agree at
  Frobenius elements of good-reduction primes ℓ ∤ pN (Frobenius has
  det = ℓ mod p by the reduction/point-counting machinery of
  GoodReduction.lean) and Chebotarev (the Chebotarev.lean node)
  makes Frobenii dense, forcing equality. So the Weil-pairing cone
  reduces to GoodReduction + Chebotarev + a Frobenius-det
  computation — no elliptic-net/Miller-function layer needed.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, RESULTANT NODE ELIMINATED `cb7f744`):
  psi34's certificate elaborated (40M heartbeats, set-staged
  cofactors, inlined 55-term relation-cofactor in the
  linear_combination — a set-bound cofactor is an opaque ring-atom,
  must be inlined); PhiPsiCoprime.lean is SORRY-FREE. Flat.lean
  patched: resultant_Φ_ΨSq DELETED, isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq restated for
  fields with the direct proof. 17 → 16 nodes. The full-cone rebuild
  + axiom audit in flight; expected: the ENTIRE torsion-card
  machinery becomes sorryAx-free except the finite-flat construction
  Flat.lean:163. ELABORATION LESSONS: giant certificate statements
  need set-staged big terms (MVar-synthesis times out otherwise);
  linear_combination cofactors must be inline expressions.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, RESULTANT REPLACEMENT EXECUTED): the direct
  coprimality is implemented: (1) `EDSRank.lean` (all proven) — the
  rank-of-apparition machinery (IsRank, c_eq_zero_of_adjacent via
  T(·,2) at n = r−1, le_three_of_adjacent, degenerate_of_adjacent:
  adjacent zeros force (b,c) = (0,0) at rank 2 or (c,d) = (0,0),
  b ≠ 0 at rank 3, dvd_of_eq_zero: the T(k−r,r)-descent).
  (2) `PhiPsiCoprime.lean` — no_common_root (alg-closed; the
  y-quadratic lift, evalEval_ψ_normEDS, the Φ-definition parity
  bridge, on-curve b² = Ψ₂Sq(x₀), rank-divides-consecutive
  contradiction; NONSINGULARITY NOT EVEN NEEDED — only the Equation)
  and isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_field (natAbs-reduction + gcd-root descent to
  the algebraic closure). The two degenerate cases are closed by
  sympy-extracted Sylvester-cofactor Bézout certificates:
  psi23 (F·Ψ₂Sq + G·Ψ₃ = −Δ², 36/26-term cofactors, PROVEN) and
  psi34 (F·Ψ₃ + G·preΨ₄ = Δ⁴, 266/164-term cofactors + 55-term
  b-relation cofactor, elaborating at time of writing). KEY FACTS:
  res(Ψ₂Sq,Ψ₃) = −Δ² and res(Ψ₃,preΨ₄) = Δ⁴ modulo
  4b₈ = b₂b₆ − b₄² — pure Δ-powers, no 2-factors, char-2-safe;
  extraction via integral Sylvester-adjugate columns (NOT naive
  solve/gcdex — those time out or introduce junk lc-factors).
  NEXT: verify psi34-elaboration, patch Flat.lean (staged:
  isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq restated for fields, proven from
  PhiPsiCoprime; resultant_Φ_ΨSq DELETED), rebuild the cone —
  separable_preΨ' and the whole torsion machinery then become
  sorryAx-FREE except Flat.lean:163.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, RESULTANT-NODE ATTACK PLAN): the consumers
  only use `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` (Bézout with Δ-unit), never the actual
  resultant VALUE — so the node can be REPLACED by a direct
  coprimality proof, eliminating the ±Δ^k-formula entirely. Route:
  over k̄ (field-reduction of IsCoprime along faithfully-flat/field
  extension — for k → k̄ use gcd-descent), a common root x₀ of
  (Φₙ, ΨSqₙ) lifts to a curve point P = (x₀, y₀); the ψ-values
  wₖ := ψₖ(P) form an elliptic sequence (evalEval_ψ_T, PROVEN) with
  w₁ = 1; ΨSq-vanishing gives wₙ = 0; Φ-vanishing + the Φ-definition
  Φₙ = XΨSqₙ − preΨₙ₊₁preΨₙ₋₁(parity) gives wₙ₊₁wₙ₋₁-vanishing
  (2-torsion x₀ handled separately), so an ADJACENT PAIR of zeros
  (wₙ, wₙ₊₁) or (wₙ, wₙ₋₁). CLAIM (rigidity WITHOUT Bézout —
  breaking the old circularity): adjacent zeros are impossible, by
  the T(·,2)-quadratic recursion run as a two-sided induction: with
  w_d = w_{d+1} = 0 (d minimal ≥ 2, so w_{d−1} ≠ 0), the instances
  w_{m+2}w_{m−2} = b²w_{m+1}w_{m−1} − c·w_m² at m = d+1, d+2, …
  propagate zeros forward (w_{d+3}w_{d−1} = 0 ⟹ w_{d+3} = 0, then
  c·w_{d+2}² = 0, …) and the case-analysis on the seed values
  b = ψ₂(P), c = ψ₃(P) (using the PROVEN c=0-closed-forms
  normEDS_c_zero_closed and the ★-companion) forces w₁ = 0 or an
  explicit contradiction. All ingredients are proven EDS-machinery;
  no new certificates expected. This closes resultant_Φ_ΨSq's
  consumer (isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq gets a direct proof; the stated
  resultant-formula node can then be DELETED or left as a
  historical remark — prefer restating the node file to make
  isCoprime the primitive). CAUTION: check where in TorsionCard the
  dictionary/climb machinery itself uses isCoprime — the new proof
  must sit UPSTREAM (in the EDS-files or a new file importing only
  Points + EDSStange), then Flat.lean's isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq becomes a
  re-export. NEXT: implement, starting with the value-level
  adjacent-zeros-impossible lemma over a field.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, SEPARABILITY COMPLETE `8d1108e`): the
  generic-fibre plan is fully EXECUTED — `exists_good_chord`,
  `exists_large_fibre`, `torsion_finset_of_fibre`,
  `separable_of_torsion_finset` all PROVEN; `separable_preΨ'` is
  resolved in ALL characteristics. 18 → 17 nodes. TorsionCardSep.lean
  is sorry-free. Key implementation notes: (a) the Wronskian-nonzero
  case-split (char ≠ 2 via coeff_preΨ_ne_zero at 2p; char 2 via
  ΨSqₚ′ = 0 and the p²-top-coefficient of Φₚ′); (b) nonvanishing of
  ΨSqₚ/Ψ₂Sq from IsCoprime-with-zero degeneracy (unit vs natDegree);
  (c) the abscissa-pinning x′ = c by mul_right_cancel₀ on the proven
  x-formula; (d) R not 2-torsion via evalEvalRingHom applied to
  C_Ψ₂Sq with the curve equation; (e) class-halving by
  Finset.card_bij with the negation involution (pointsAt is
  neg-closed). The ENTIRE torsion-card cone now rests on exactly TWO
  upstream nodes: resultant_Φ_ΨSq (Flat.lean:233) and the
  torsion-flat construction (Flat.lean:163).
- 2026-07-17 (session 6 FINAL PLAN, the closed-field char-2 node has
  a COMPLETE ELEMENTARY ROUTE — char-free, no literature needed):
  prove #E[p](K̄) = p² by GENERIC-FIBRE COUNTING, then read
  separability backwards. Steps, all with existing machinery:
  (1) Φₚ′ ≠ 0 in every characteristic with (p:K) ≠ 0: its leading
  coefficient is p²·(top of f²) — in char 2, Φₚ′ = f² + (AB)′Ψ₂Sq
  with deg((AB)′Ψ₂Sq) ≤ p²−2 < p²−1 = deg f², and (p²:K) ≠ 0; hence
  by (W)-char-2 also preΨ₂ₚ = p⁻¹Φₚ′f² ≠ 0.
  (2) The c-resultant R(c) := Res_x(Φₚ − c·ΨSqₚ, Φₚ′ − c·ΨSqₚ′) is
  not identically 0 (else every Φ−cS is inseparable; use the
  Wronskian Φ′S − ΦS′ = p·preΨ₂ₚ ≠ 0 to rule this out — a common
  factor of Φ−cS and Φ′−cS′ for ALL c would divide the Wronskian).
  Cheaper equivalent: choose c avoiding the finitely many roots of
  disc-like data: ∃ c ∈ K with Φ−cS separable, deg = p² (leading
  coeff 1, monic ✓), and S ∤-vanishing at its roots, c ≠ x-coords of
  2-torsion images etc. — all finite exclusions, K infinite.
  (3) Each of the p² distinct roots x of Φ − cS has ΨSq(x) ≠ 0 and
  x-value of p•(x,y) equal to c (the PROVEN x-formula/dictionary);
  the y-fibre above each root has exactly 2 points (yQuad separable
  since the point is not 2-torsion — ψ₂ ≠ 0 there for suitable c).
  That is 2p² points P with x(p•P) = c, i.e. p•P ∈ {R, −R} where
  R = (c,d): the involution P ↦ −P swaps the two classes, so
  #[p]⁻¹(R) = p² for R ≠ −R (generic c avoids ψ₂-locus of R).
  (4) Fibres of the GROUP HOM [p] are ker-cosets: one fibre of size
  p² ⟹ #E[p] = p² — no surjectivity of [p] needed.
  (5) Backwards: #E[p]∖0 = p²−1 maps 2-to-1 onto roots of f (odd
  p-torsion is never 2-torsion; yQuad-fibres of size 2 via
  isCoprime_Ψ₂Sq_preΨ' — already in the tail), so f has
  (p²−1)/2 = deg f DISTINCT roots ⟹ f = unit·∏(X−rᵢ) distinct ⟹
  Separable via separable_prod_X_sub_C_iff (K = K̄ splits ✓).
  This closes separable_preΨ'_char_two_closed with ~300 elementary
  lines and NO new axioms/literature; it is also a template that
  would re-prove the char ≠ 2 case (not needed). IMPLEMENT NEXT.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, char-2 reduction `916e56f`+):
  `separable_preΨ'_char_two` is now DERIVED from the strictly smaller
  node `separable_preΨ'_char_two_closed` (algebraically closed base)
  via `Polynomial.separable_map` + `map_preΨ'` + the
  baseChange-composition identity (term-mode `congrArg` to dodge the
  module-system rw-matching friction). Over K = K̄ char 2 the
  Frobenius decomposition f = u² + X·v², f′ = v² is available:
  π | f, f′ ⟹ π | u and π | v. Remaining gap: a structural
  obstruction to gcd(u,v) ≠ 1 — candidate: Gunji 1976 char-2
  disc(ψₚ) formula (annas-mcp next session), or the universal
  discriminant route (generic-fiber separability over ℚ(A) is now a
  theorem; missing only the ±pˢΔᵗ-structure via Δ-irreducibility +
  Nullstellensatz — the SAME machinery the resultant node needs).
- 2026-07-17 (session 6 final, UNIFICATION INSIGHT): the two
  remaining torsion-cone blockers — `resultant_Φ_ΨSq` and
  `separable_preΨ'_char_two` — are instances of ONE technique: a
  universal identity in ℤ[A₁..A₅] whose specialization is controlled
  by (p, Δ)-powers. Concretely for the discriminant route:
  disc(preΨ'ₚ) ∈ ℤ[A] is NONZERO because the char-≠2 separability
  PROOF NOW APPLIES OVER ℚ(A₁..A₅) — the generic curve over the
  fraction field of the polynomial ring (char 0, Δ ≠ 0 a unit there
  after inverting, (p) ≠ 0). The structure disc = ±p^s·Δ^t·(monomial
  unit?) then follows if one shows disc vanishes only on the
  Δ = 0-locus (Nullstellensatz + irreducibility/radicality of (Δ) in
  ℚ̄[A]) with multiplicity bookkeeping; the same scheme gives
  resultant_Φ_ΨSq = ±Δ^k. ALTERNATIVE cheaper for char-2-only: the
  consumer of separable_preΨ' is prime_torsion_card [IsSepClosed k]
  — over sep-closed k one may normalize the char-2 curve (kill
  coefficients by the standard char-2 variable changes: a₁ ≠ 0 ⟹
  (a₁,a₂,a₃,a₄,a₆) → (1,a₂',0,0,a₆'); a₁ = 0 supersingular ⟹
  (0,0,a₃',a₄',a₆')) and re-run the ν-endgame with the explicit
  simplified b-invariants (b₂ = 1/0, Ψ₂Sq = X²-ish/b₆-const) where
  the [2]/[3]-composition H₁-terms can be analyzed term-by-term.
  Sharpest known classical statement: Gunji (1976) computes disc(ψₚ)
  in char 2; Washington Ch. 3 exercises give disc(ψₙ) = ±n^{...}Δ^{...}
  integrally — download and mine these next session (annas-mcp).
- 2026-07-17 (session 6 coda, char-2 CAUTION): re-deriving the
  `separable_preΨ'_char_two` plan shows the PREVIOUSLY RECORDED
  [3]-composition count is NOT by itself contradictory: with
  ν := ν_π, f = πᵃg, in char 2 (W) reads Φₚ′f² = p·preΨ₂ₚ (ΨSq′ = 0),
  and the m = 3 cross Φ₃ₚ·S·Ψ₃hom² = ΨSq₃ₚ·Φ₃hom (S := ΨSqₚ,
  homogeneous degrees 9 = 1 + 2·4) with Ψ₃hom ≡ Φₚ⁴, Φ₃hom ≡ Φₚ⁹
  (mod π) gives ν(Φ₃ₚ) + 2a = ν(ΨSq₃ₚ), which the EDS-divisibility
  ν(preΨ'₃ₚ) ≥ a matches EXACTLY (ν(ΨSq₃ₚ) = 2a, ν(Φ₃ₚ) = 0) — no
  contradiction without using π | f′. The char-2 argument must
  inject the hypothesis π | (preΨ'ₚ)′ elsewhere: candidate routes:
  (i) differentiate the m = 3 cross identity itself (the derivative
  of ΨSq₃ₚ = (preΨ'₃ₚ)² is again 0 in char 2 — but the derivative of
  the CROSS identity relates Φ₃ₚ′ to Wronskian-type combinations
  where (W)-at-3p and (W)-at-p interact: in char 2,
  (W)ₚ: Φₚ′f² = p·preΨ₂ₚ and (W)₃ₚ: Φ₃ₚ′ΨSq₃ₚ = 3p·preΨ₆ₚ, and
  ν-counts of preΨ₂ₚ/preΨ₆ₚ through the even-index structure
  ΨSq₂ₚ = preΨ'₂ₚ²Ψ₂Sq may force ν(Φₚ′) contradictions);
  (ii) the char-2 Frobenius structure: in char 2, f′ = (odd-part)′ and
  f′ = 0 ⟺ f ∈ k[X²] = (k[X])²-Frobenius-image; π | f, π | f′ with
  π ∤ ... — work with the derivation d/dX directly on the
  ψ₂-normalized forms (Ψ₂Sq = b₂X² + b₆ is itself a square in char 2:
  Ψ₂Sq = (a₁X + c)² when b₆ = c², i.e. AFTER adjoining √b₆ — over
  the separable-closure-bound fields the argument may simplify);
  (iii) check Washington's or Gunji's char-2 treatment of division-
  polynomial discriminants (literature check needed). NEXT SESSION:
  resolve this honestly — the char-2 node is NOT mechanical from the
  current identities alone.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6, MAJOR): **(W) PROVEN and `separable_preΨ'`
  RESOLVED (char ≠ 2)**. The full derivation chain, all committed:
  (1) InvariantDerivation.lean — dX/dY/Dham (Hamiltonian derivation
  Fy·∂X − Fx·∂Y on ℤ[A][X][Y], kills F identically), DB (descent to
  Buniv via liftOfSurjective), DK (hand-rolled fraction-field
  extension with quotient rule: DK_welldef/spec/rel/add/mul/sub/div/
  sq/coeffHom + base values DK_tautX = ψ₂, DK_tautY = −Fx — all
  axiom-clean). MODULE-SYSTEM CAVEAT learned: group-section
  Derivation lemmas (map_sub/map_neg) have an
  AddCommGroup.toAddCommMonoid instance path that is NOT
  defeq-checkable under exposure — stay in the base
  AddCommMonoid-section lemmas (map_add, leibniz, leibniz_pow) and
  write negations INSIDE C-coefficients.
  (2) WronskianStep.lean — DK_addition_step + DK_doubling_step (the
  differentiated chord and tangent laws), by polynomial certificates
  saturated by (xn−x1)^4/5 resp. ψ₂(P₁)^4/5, cofactors extracted by
  explicit linear elimination (L-linear then geometric-series in l;
  scripts/eds/wronskian_{step,doubling}_cofactors.py) — sympy-verified
  and accepted by linear_combination essentially on first compile.
  (3) WronskianInduction.lean — DK_smul_taut ([n]*ω = nω at the
  tautological point, strong induction n=1/n=2/chord), then
  wronskian_taut (differentiate xₙ·ΨSqₙ = Φₙ, use the strong-aux
  TRACKING ψ₂(nP)ψₙ⁴ = ψ₂ₙ and ψ₂ₙ = preΨ₂ₙ·ψ₂, cancel DK x = ψ₂),
  univ_wronskian (pullback via taut_C_injective), wronskian (any
  CommRing): **Φₙ′ΨSqₙ − ΦₙΨSqₙ′ = n·preΨ₂ₙ**.
  (4) TorsionCard SPLIT: separable_preΨ' + prime_torsion_card +
  card_torsionBy moved to TorsionCardSep.lean (breaks the import
  cycle; Torsion.lean imports it).
  (5) separable_preΨ' PROVEN in TorsionCardSep by the ν_π endgame
  (uniform in a — no case split: π^{a+1} | ΨSqₚ′ ⟹ (W) ⟹
  π^{a+1} | preΨ₂ₚ ⟹ π^{2a+1} | ΨSq₂ₚ ⟹ (C)+coprime₂ₚ ⟹
  π^{2a+1} | H = π^{2a}g²H₁ ⟹ π | H₁ ≡ 4Φₚ³ ⟹ π | Φₚ ⟹ ⊥ with
  coprimeₚ). NEW smaller node: `separable_preΨ'_char_two`
  (TorsionCardSep.lean) — char-2 case; needs the [3]-composition
  (taut_cross m=3 specialized like cross_two; Ψ₃hom ≡ 3Φ⁴, 3 ≠ 0 in
  char 2, b₂-subcase analysis; scripts/eds verified J₃-data).
  Node count still 18 (one closed, one smaller one opened); the
  torsion cone now rests on: resultant_Φ_ΨSq, Flat.lean:163,
  separable_preΨ'_char_two.
- 2026-07-17 (session 6): **(C) IS PROVEN** (`ed3752d`,
  TautMultiplication.lean): `taut_smul_formula` (machinery instance at
  taut), `taut_cross` (general (m,n) composition cross-identity from
  `smul_smul` + `some.inj`), `taut_cross_two` (m=2, denominators
  cleared by field_simp at the generic point), `univ_cross_two`
  (pulled back to ℤ[A][X] via taut_eval_C_mk + taut_C_injective):
  `Φ(2n)·Ψ₂Sqhom(Φₙ,ΨSqₙ) = ΨSq(2n)·Φ₂hom(Φₙ,ΨSqₙ)` with the
  explicit homogenized quartics, and `cross_two` (any curve, any
  CommRing, via eval₂Hom). The CROSS form suffices for the endgame:
  ν(Φ₂ₚ)=0 (coprime-node + ν(ΨSq₂ₚ)≥2), so ν(H)=ν(ΨSq₂ₚ)≥2(2a−1)
  yet H≡4Φₚ³ (mod π) gives ν(H)=0 — no exactness-splitting needed.
  Also new: `taut_eval_C_mk` + `taut_C_injective` (univariate value
  bridge + y-free injectivity, axiom-clean). REMAINING for
  `separable_preΨ'`: (W) at p. PLAN (session 6): Hamiltonian
  derivation D := Fy·∂X − Fx·∂Y on ℤ[A][X][Y] (D(F)=0 trivially),
  descend to Buniv via `Derivation.liftOfSurjective`
  (mk-surjective, ker=(F) D-stable), hand-rolled quotient-rule
  extension DK to Kuniv (~150 lines; no mathlib fraction-field
  derivation exists), then INVARIANT-DIFFERENTIAL INDUCTION at the
  tautological point: Claim A: DK(xₙ) = n·sₙ (sₙ := 2yₙ+a₁xₙ+a₃),
  Claim B: DK(yₙ) = −n·Fx(xₙ,yₙ), base n=1 is DK(tautX) = ψ₂-value
  BY CONSTRUCTION, step = differentiate the affine addition law
  (sympy-verify first), then (W) by differentiating the PROVEN
  x-formula xₙ·ΨSqₙval = Φₙval and cancelling s₁ via the tracking
  sₙψₙ⁴ = ψ₂ₙ: n·preΨ(2n)val = (Φₙ'ΨSqₙ − ΦₙΨSqₙ')val, pull back
  by taut_C_injective, specialize. Then the ν_π endgame.
- 2026-07-17 (session 5 coda): the tautological-point VALUE BRIDGE is
  proven (`taut_evalEval_mk`: evalEval at `(tautX, tautY)` = the
  quotient map; `taut_psi_ne_zero`: all `ψₙ`-values nonzero at the
  generic point) — both axiom-clean. The (C)-composition derivation at
  the generic point is now purely mechanical: instantiate
  `exists_smul_some_eq`/tracking at `(tautX, tautY)` over `Kuniv`,
  compose, cross-multiply, and pull back along `taut_evalEval_mk` +
  basis-injectivity. Then the UFD multiplicity endgame closes
  `separable_preΨ'` (modulo the (W)-differentiated-descent for the
  Wronskian at primes and `resultant_Φ_ΨSq`).
