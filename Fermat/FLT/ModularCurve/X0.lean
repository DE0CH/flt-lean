# `Y_0(N)` as a coarse moduli space over `ℚ`

This module supplies the **missing modular-curve layer** behind Kenku's
half of the Mazur–Kenku isogeny classification, i.e. behind the twelve
level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean`
(`WeierstrassCurve.not_cyclicIsogeny_prod_two_primes`,
`…_twenty`, `…_twentyFour`, `…_twentyEight`, `…_thirty`, `…_thirtySix`,
`…_fortyTwo`, `…_fortyFive`, `…_fifty`, `…_fiftyFour`, `…_sixtyThree`,
`…_seventyFive`).

## Why this layer has to exist at all

Every one of those twelve statements is, mathematically, the assertion

> the modular curve `Y_0(N)` has no `ℚ`-rational point,

for a level `N` of genus `≥ 1` (`20, 24, 36` have genus `1`; `28, 50`
genus `2`; `30, 45` genus `3`; `54` genus `4`; `42, 63, 75` genus `5`;
and already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`).  A survey of the pin on 2026-07-26
found **no modular curves anywhere**: `grep ModularCurve` over the whole
of `.lake/packages/mathlib` returns nothing,
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/ModularForms/` contains modular *forms* rather than
curves or Jacobians, and `~/cs/FLT` takes the strictly weaker Mazur
torsion bound as a bare `axiom` (`FLT/Assumptions/Mazur.lean`).  So the
twelve statements could not even be *phrased* as what they are; they were
phrased instead as statements about a Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of an
elliptic curve over `ℚ`, which is the moduli *input*, not the modular
curve.

What this module does is exactly that rephrasing, and nothing more: it
writes down the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem and its coarse moduli space, and
restates the twelve levels as `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.  The mathematical content
of the twelve nodes is untouched — it is *relocated* onto an object where
the Kenku/Ogg arguments (Mordell–Weil ranks of `J_0(N)`, Chabauty) can
one day be run.

## Design: Yoneda, following `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`

The elliptic scheme is `Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct` from
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean` — a commutative group structure on the
functor of points, plus properness, smoothness and geometrically
connected fibres — together with `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1`, which is
what cuts abelian schemes down to elliptic curves.  Presenting the group
law through the functor of points rather than as a morphism
`E ×_T E ⟶ E` means no chosen pullbacks and no monoidal structure on
`Over T` are needed, which is the only reason this is writable at this
pin at all.

Three consequences shape everything below.

* **The level structure is a closed subgroup scheme, not a subfunctor.**
  A `Γ₀(N)`-structure is a finite closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`, and
  membership of a relative point in it is *factoring through the closed
  immersion* (`RelPoint.LiesIn`).  Taking a bare subfunctor of the
  functor of points instead would be strictly weaker — an arbitrary
  subfunctor need not be representable, the moduli problem would then be
  larger than the true one, and its coarse space larger than `Y_0(N)`,
  which is precisely the way a level statement could silently become
  false.  Representability is bought here by carrying `C` as an actual
  scheme.

* **Base change is stated relationally, never constructed**
  (`IsBaseChangeOf`).  The moduli "functor" is only a functor up to
  isomorphism, so instead of forming pullbacks and transporting the
  group structure — expensive, and unnecessary — the naturality axiom
  quantifies over cartesian squares.  Note that this *also* delivers
  isomorphism-invariance for free: an isomorphic datum over the same base
  is a base change along the identity, so a natural transformation out of
  the moduli problem is automatically constant on isomorphism classes,
  which is what makes "initial among such" the coarse space of the
  moduli *stack* rather than of some rigidified variant.

* **`Y_0(N)`, not `X_0(N)`.**  The affine coarse space suffices, so no
  compactification, no cusps and no genus theory are needed here: the
  statement "`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists only of cusps" is literally
  "`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`".  This is a deliberate scope cut — it removes an
  entire missing theory (the smooth compactification of a coarse moduli
  space, and the rationality of its cusps) from the critical path without
  weakening any statement.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT

There are exactly three sorried claim-shapes here, and each is true:

1. `exists_coarseModuliY0 N` — the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem over `ℚ` admits
   a coarse moduli space.  TRUE: this is the classical existence
   statement for `Y_0(N)` (Deligne–Rapoport, Katz–Mazur; or classically
   via the `j`-line and the modular polynomial).

2. `nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable` — an elliptic curve over `ℚ` with a
   Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` in `E(ℚ̄)` gives a
   `Γ₀(N)`-datum over `Spec ℚ`.  TRUE, and this is where two further
   missing theories are folded together and left for a successor: the
   projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
   `Spec ℚ`, and the finite étale closed subgroup scheme attached to a
   Galois-stable finite subgroup of `E(ℚ̄)` (char `0`, so Galois descent
   for finite étale schemes is the whole content).

3. `Y0HasNoRationalPoint N` at the twelve levels.  TRUE: the levels `N`
   with `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67,
   163}` (Mazur 1978, Kenku 1979–1982), and none of `20, 24, 28, 30, 36,
   42, 45, 50, 54, 63, 75` — nor any product of two distinct primes
   outside `{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}` — lies in that list.

**Why the interface must pin `Y` down, and does.** A weaker interface —
say, a smooth projective curve over `ℚ` with a bijection on `ℚ̄`-points
— would be satisfied by `ℙ¹` for a cheap reason, and then
`Y0HasNoRationalPoint 20` would be FALSE rather than open, which is worse
than leaving the node untouched.  What rules that out is the *universal
property*: `IsCoarseModuliY0` asks for initiality among all `ℚ`-schemes
receiving a natural transformation from the moduli problem, and an
initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism.  So any `Y` satisfying
this interface is `ℚ`-isomorphic to the genuine `Y_0(N)`, and (3) is a
statement about the genuine `Y_0(N)`.

## What is NOT here, and is the next decomposition

This module deliberately stops at the coarse moduli space.  It does not
build, and the twelve level nodes still need:

* `J_0(N)` and its Mordell–Weil group (`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` is proved by
  bounding `J_0(N)(ℚ)`);
* the Hecke algebra and the Eisenstein / winding quotient, which is what
  supplies the rank-`0` input;
* for the higher-genus levels, Chabauty–Coleman.

Those are three independent subtrees, none of which exists at this pin.

/-! ### Relative points and a closed subscheme -/

/-- **A relative point lies in a subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`** when it factors
through `ι`.

For `ι` a closed immersion this is the functor-of-points description of
the closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`: it is a *subfunctor* of the functor of
points of `E` by construction (precomposition preserves factoring), so no
naturality axiom is needed for it anywhere below. -/
def RelPoint.LiesIn {E T C : Scheme.{u}} {f : E ⟶ T} (ι : C ⟶ E)
    {T' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T' ⟶ T} (x : RelPoint f g) : Prop :=
  ∃ y : T' ⟶ C, y ≫ ι = x.1

/-- **Transport of a relative point along a morphism lying over the
base.** If `map : E' ⟶ E` fits in a commuting square over `h : T' ⟶ T`
then a `T''`-point of `E'` over `g : T'' ⟶ T'` becomes a `T''`-point of
`E` over `g ≫ h`.

When the square is *cartesian* this map is the canonical identification
of the points of the base change with the points of `E` over the shifted
base point; it is used below only through cartesian squares, but nothing
in its definition needs that. -/
def RelPoint.along {E' T' E T : Scheme.{u}} {f' : E' ⟶ T'} {f : E ⟶ T}
    {h : T' ⟶ T} (map : E' ⟶ E) (hw : f' ≫ h = map ≫ f)
    {T'' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T'' ⟶ T'} (x : RelPoint f' g) :
    RelPoint f (g ≫ h) :=
  ⟨x.1 ≫ map, by rw [Category.assoc, ← hw, ← Category.assoc, x.2]⟩

/-! ### Cyclic subgroup schemes of order `N` -/

/-- **A cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N` of an abelian scheme.**

The data is a closed subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`, finite over the base, whose
relative points form a subgroup of the relative points of `E` at every
base point, and whose geometric fibres are cyclic of order exactly `N`.

Three remarks on the axioms.

* Closedness and finiteness are what make this a subgroup *scheme*
  rather than a subfunctor; see the module docstring for why that
  distinction is load-bearing for faithfulness.
* The subgroup conditions are stated at *every* base point `g : T' ⟶ T`,
  which is the functor-of-points way of saying that the group law of `E`
  restricts to `C`; no naturality is required because `LiesIn` is a
  subfunctor automatically.
* `geom_cyclic` is the level-structure condition proper.  Over an
  algebraically closed field the relative points at a geometric point are
  the geometric points of that fibre, and the condition says they meet
  `C` in a cyclic group of order `N`.  In residue characteristic `0` —
  the only case used here — this is equivalent to `C` being finite étale
  with cyclic geometric fibres, so nothing is lost by phrasing it
  pointwise. -/

/-! ### The `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem -/

/-- **A `Γ₀(N)`-structure over a scheme `T`**: an elliptic scheme over
`T` together with a cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N`.

"Elliptic scheme" is spelled out as *abelian scheme of relative dimension
one*: `AbelianSchemeStruct f` already carries properness, smoothness,
geometrically connected fibres, a zero section and a commutative group
law on the functor of points, and `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f` is what
makes the fibres curves rather than abelian varieties of arbitrary
dimension.

This is the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` of Katz–Mazur; its coarse space over
`ℚ` is `Y_0(N)`. -/

  /-- the abelian-scheme structure on `f` -/

  /-- relative dimension one: the fibres are curves -/
  relativeDimensionOne : SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f
  /-- the `Γ₀(N)`-level structure -/
  cyc : CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab N

/-- **`d'` is a base change of `d` along `h : T' ⟶ T`.**

Rather than construct pullbacks and transport structure along them, the
base-change relation is *stated*: a morphism `map` on total spaces making
a cartesian square, compatible with the group law and with the level
structure.  `RelPoint.along map isPullback.w` is the induced map on
relative points, and cartesianness is what makes it a bijection onto the
points over the shifted base point — a fact this development never needs
and therefore never proves.

Taking `h = 𝟙` recovers *isomorphism* of `Γ₀(N)`-data over a fixed base,
which is why a natural transformation out of the moduli problem (in the
sense of `IsCoarseModuliY0.classify_natural` below) is automatically
constant on isomorphism classes. -/

/-! ### The coarse moduli space -/

/-- **`str : Y ⟶ S` is a coarse moduli space for the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli
problem.**

The data is a classifying map sending a `Γ₀(N)`-structure over an
`S`-scheme `T` to a `T`-point of `Y`, natural in cartesian squares, which
is *initial* among all such.  This is Mumford's definition of a
categorical quotient / coarse moduli space, with the bijectivity on
geometric points — the second half of the usual definition — deliberately
omitted: initiality already determines `(Y, classify)` up to unique
isomorphism, which is all that faithfulness of the level statements
requires, and stating the geometric bijection would additionally require
a theory of isomorphisms of `Γ₀(N)`-data that nothing here consumes.

Over `S = Spec ℚ` the unique such `Y` is the modular curve `Y_0(N)`. -/
structure IsCoarseModuliY0 (N : ℕ) {Y S : Scheme.{u}} (str : Y ⟶ S) where
  /-- the classifying map of the moduli problem -/
  classify : ∀ {T : Scheme.{u}} (g : T ⟶ S), Gamma0Datum N T → RelPoint str g
  /-- the classifying map is natural: a base change of data is sent to the

  transformation from the moduli problem -/

      (hg : h ≫ g = g') {d' : Gamma0Datum N T'} {d : Gamma0Datum N T},
      IsBaseChangeOf h d' d → c g' d' = RelPoint.pre h hg (c g d)) →
    ∃! u : Y ⟶ Y', u ≫ str' = str ∧
      ∀ {T : Scheme.{u}} (g : T ⟶ S) (d : Gamma0Datum N T),
        (c g d).1 = (classify g d).1 ≫ u

/-- **`Spec ℚ`**, the base of every modular curve considered here. -/
noncomputable abbrev SpecQ : Scheme.{0} := Spec (CommRingCat.of ℚ)

/-- **`Y_0(N)` has no rational point.**

Stated over every coarse moduli space of the `Γ₀(N)`-problem rather than
over a chosen one, so that no choice has to be made before
`exists_coarseModuliY0` is available; by initiality all of them are
canonically `ℚ`-isomorphic, so this is a statement about the genuine
`Y_0(N)`.

`RelPoint str (𝟙 SpecQ)` is by definition the set of sections of
`str : Y ⟶ Spec ℚ`, i.e. `Y(ℚ)`. -/
def Y0HasNoRationalPoint (N : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (Y : Scheme.{0}) (str : Y ⟶ SpecQ),

/-! ### The existence of `Y_0(N)`, and the bridge from Weierstrass curves -/

/-- **Existence of the coarse moduli space `Y_0(N)`** (sorry node).

TRUE, and classical: the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` over `ℚ` is a separated
Deligne–Mumford stack of finite type, hence has a coarse moduli space
(Deligne–Rapoport, *Les schémas de modules de courbes elliptiques*,
Antwerp II, 1973; Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic moduli of elliptic curves*,
1985).  Classically one may instead construct it by hand as the
normalisation of the plane curve cut out by the modular polynomial
`Φ_N(X, Y)` inside `𝔸¹ × 𝔸¹`, with the classifying map
`(E, C) ↦ (j(E), j(E/C))`.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin: no modular curve, no modular polynomial,
no moduli stack and no coarse-space existence theorem exists anywhere in
`Mathlib` or in `~/cs/FLT` (surveyed 2026-07-26). -/

/-- **A Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` of `E(ℚ̄)` is a
`Γ₀(N)`-structure over `Spec ℚ`** (sorry node).

This is the bridge between the elementary phrasing used in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` — a Weierstrass curve over `ℚ` and a point
of order `N` over `ℚ̄` generating a Galois-stable subgroup — and the
moduli problem.  TRUE, and it folds together two independent missing
theories:

* the projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
  `Spec ℚ`: `Mathlib` has `WeierstrassCurve`, `IsElliptic`, and the group
  law on the points over a field, but not the elliptic curve as a *group
  scheme*, so `AbelianSchemeStruct` for it must be constructed;
* Galois descent for the finite subgroup: `⟨g⟩ ⊆ E(ℚ̄)` is finite and
  Galois-stable, and in characteristic `0` such a subgroup is exactly the
  set of geometric points of a unique finite étale closed subgroup scheme
  `C ⊆ E` over `ℚ` — this is the equivalence between finite étale
  `ℚ`-schemes and finite `Γ_ℚ`-sets.

`hstable` is verbatim the stability hypothesis carried by the twelve
level nodes, so no reformulation happens at the boundary. -/

/-- **The consumption rule of this module.**

If `Y_0(N)` has no rational point but some elliptic curve over `ℚ` has a
Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N`, then the classifying map
produces a rational point of `Y_0(N)` — a contradiction.  This is the one
place where the three sorried inputs above meet, and it is what the
twelve level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` call. -/

/-! ### The twelve levels of Kenku's non-prime-power determination

Each statement below is the level `N` of the Mazur–Kenku classification,
restated as a claim about the rational points of the modular curve
`Y_0(N)`.  The levels `N` for which `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly

`1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163`

Theory 15 (1982)), and none of the levels below is in that list.

All of them are IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason: each
is a determination of the rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and
neither `J_0(N)`, nor its Mordell–Weil group, nor Chabauty–Coleman exists
in this development.  See the module docstring for the three subtrees

Those five products are exactly the semiprimes in the Mazur–Kenku list.
