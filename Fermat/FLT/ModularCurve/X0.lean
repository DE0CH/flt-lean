# `Y_0(N)` as a coarse moduli space over `ℚ`

This module supplies the **missing modular-curve layer** behind Kenku's
half of the Mazur–Kenku isogeny classification, i.e. behind the twelve
level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean`
(`WeierstrassCurve.not_cyclicIsogeny_prod_two_primes`,
`…_twenty`, `…_twentyFour`, `…_twentyEight`, `…_thirty`, `…_thirtySix`,
`…_fortyTwo`, `…_fortyFive`, `…_fifty`, `…_fiftyFour`, `…_sixtyThree`,
`…_seventyFive`).

## Why this layer has to exist at all

Every one of those twelve statements is, mathematically, the assertion

> the modular curve `Y_0(N)` has no `ℚ`-rational point,

for a level `N` of genus `≥ 1` (`20, 24, 36` have genus `1`; `28, 50`
genus `2`; `30, 45` genus `3`; `54` genus `4`; `42, 63, 75` genus `5`;
and already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`).  A survey of the pin on 2026-07-26
found **no modular curves anywhere**: `grep ModularCurve` over the whole
of `.lake/packages/mathlib` returns nothing,
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/ModularForms/` contains modular *forms* rather than
curves or Jacobians, and `~/cs/FLT` takes the strictly weaker Mazur
torsion bound as a bare `axiom` (`FLT/Assumptions/Mazur.lean`).  So the
twelve statements could not even be *phrased* as what they are; they were
phrased instead as statements about a Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of an
elliptic curve over `ℚ`, which is the moduli *input*, not the modular
curve.

What this module does is exactly that rephrasing, and nothing more: it
writes down the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem and its coarse moduli space, and
restates the twelve levels as `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.  The mathematical content
of the twelve nodes is untouched — it is *relocated* onto an object where
the Kenku/Ogg arguments (Mordell–Weil ranks of `J_0(N)`, Chabauty) can
one day be run.

## Design: Yoneda, following `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`

The elliptic scheme is `Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct` from
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean` — a commutative group structure on the
functor of points, plus properness, smoothness and geometrically
connected fibres — together with `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1`, which is
what cuts abelian schemes down to elliptic curves.  Presenting the group
law through the functor of points rather than as a morphism
`E ×_T E ⟶ E` means no chosen pullbacks and no monoidal structure on
`Over T` are needed, which is the only reason this is writable at this
pin at all.

Three consequences shape everything below.

* **The level structure is a closed subgroup scheme, not a subfunctor.**
  A `Γ₀(N)`-structure is a finite closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`, and
  membership of a relative point in it is *factoring through the closed
  immersion* (`RelPoint.LiesIn`).  Taking a bare subfunctor of the
  functor of points instead would be strictly weaker — an arbitrary
  subfunctor need not be representable, the moduli problem would then be
  larger than the true one, and its coarse space larger than `Y_0(N)`,
  which is precisely the way a level statement could silently become
  false.  Representability is bought here by carrying `C` as an actual
  scheme.

* **Base change is stated relationally, never constructed**
  (`IsBaseChangeOf`).  The moduli "functor" is only a functor up to
  isomorphism, so instead of forming pullbacks and transporting the
  group structure — expensive, and unnecessary — the naturality axiom
  quantifies over cartesian squares.  Note that this *also* delivers
  isomorphism-invariance for free: an isomorphic datum over the same base
  is a base change along the identity, so a natural transformation out of
  the moduli problem is automatically constant on isomorphism classes,
  which is what makes "initial among such" the coarse space of the
  moduli *stack* rather than of some rigidified variant.

* **`Y_0(N)`, not `X_0(N)`.**  The affine coarse space suffices, so no
  compactification, no cusps and no genus theory are needed here: the
  statement "`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists only of cusps" is literally
  "`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`".  This is a deliberate scope cut — it removes an
  entire missing theory (the smooth compactification of a coarse moduli
  space, and the rationality of its cusps) from the critical path without
  weakening any statement.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT

There are exactly three sorried claim-shapes here, and each is true:

1. `exists_coarseModuliY0 N` — the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem over `ℚ` admits
   a coarse moduli space.  TRUE: this is the classical existence
   statement for `Y_0(N)` (Deligne–Rapoport, Katz–Mazur; or classically
   via the `j`-line and the modular polynomial).  It is now PROVEN from a
   split of the level: `exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` (`N ≥ 1`) carries
   the citation — Katz–Mazur Theorem 6.6.1 and (8.1.1), together with a
   faithfulness audit of the one place where this module's level
   structure is weaker than theirs — and `exists_coarseModuliY0_zero`
   disposes of `N = 0`, which lies outside their theorem, from the
   elementary leaf `isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero`.

2. `nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable` — an elliptic curve over `ℚ` with a
   Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` in `E(ℚ̄)` gives a
   `Γ₀(N)`-datum over `Spec ℚ`.  TRUE, and this is where two further
   missing theories are folded together and left for a successor: the
   projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
   `Spec ℚ`, and the finite étale closed subgroup scheme attached to a
   Galois-stable finite subgroup of `E(ℚ̄)` (char `0`, so Galois descent
   for finite étale schemes is the whole content).

3. `Y0HasNoRationalPoint N` at the twelve levels.  TRUE: the levels `N`
   with `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67,
   163}` (Mazur 1978, Kenku 1979–1982), and none of `20, 24, 28, 30, 36,
   42, 45, 50, 54, 63, 75` — nor any product of two distinct primes
   outside `{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}` — lies in that list.

**Why the interface must pin `Y` down, and does.** A weaker interface —
say, a smooth projective curve over `ℚ` with a bijection on `ℚ̄`-points
— would be satisfied by `ℙ¹` for a cheap reason, and then
`Y0HasNoRationalPoint 20` would be FALSE rather than open, which is worse
than leaving the node untouched.  What rules that out is the *universal
property*: `IsCoarseModuliY0` asks for initiality among all `ℚ`-schemes
receiving a natural transformation from the moduli problem, and an
initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism.  So any `Y` satisfying
this interface is `ℚ`-isomorphic to the genuine `Y_0(N)`, and (3) is a
statement about the genuine `Y_0(N)`.

## What is NOT here, and is the next decomposition

This module deliberately stops at the coarse moduli space.  It does not
build, and the twelve level nodes still need:

* `J_0(N)` and its Mordell–Weil group (`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` is proved by
  bounding `J_0(N)(ℚ)`);
* the Hecke algebra and the Eisenstein / winding quotient, which is what
  supplies the rank-`0` input;
* for the higher-genus levels, Chabauty–Coleman.

Those are three independent subtrees, none of which exists at this pin.

/-! ### Relative points and a closed subscheme -/

/-- **A relative point lies in a subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`** when it factors
through `ι`.

For `ι` a closed immersion this is the functor-of-points description of
the closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`: it is a *subfunctor* of the functor of
points of `E` by construction (precomposition preserves factoring), so no
naturality axiom is needed for it anywhere below. -/
def RelPoint.LiesIn {E T C : Scheme.{u}} {f : E ⟶ T} (ι : C ⟶ E)
    {T' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T' ⟶ T} (x : RelPoint f g) : Prop :=
  ∃ y : T' ⟶ C, y ≫ ι = x.1

/-- **Transport of a relative point along a morphism lying over the
base.** If `map : E' ⟶ E` fits in a commuting square over `h : T' ⟶ T`
then a `T''`-point of `E'` over `g : T'' ⟶ T'` becomes a `T''`-point of
`E` over `g ≫ h`.

When the square is *cartesian* this map is the canonical identification
of the points of the base change with the points of `E` over the shifted
base point; it is used below only through cartesian squares, but nothing
in its definition needs that. -/
def RelPoint.along {E' T' E T : Scheme.{u}} {f' : E' ⟶ T'} {f : E ⟶ T}
    {h : T' ⟶ T} (map : E' ⟶ E) (hw : f' ≫ h = map ≫ f)
    {T'' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T'' ⟶ T'} (x : RelPoint f' g) :
    RelPoint f (g ≫ h) :=
  ⟨x.1 ≫ map, by rw [Category.assoc, ← hw, ← Category.assoc, x.2]⟩

/-! ### Cyclic subgroup schemes of order `N` -/

/-- **A cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N` of an abelian scheme.**

The data is a closed subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`, finite over the base, whose
relative points form a subgroup of the relative points of `E` at every
base point, and whose geometric fibres are cyclic of order exactly `N`.

Three remarks on the axioms.

* Closedness and finiteness are what make this a subgroup *scheme*
  rather than a subfunctor; see the module docstring for why that
  distinction is load-bearing for faithfulness.
* The subgroup conditions are stated at *every* base point `g : T' ⟶ T`,
  which is the functor-of-points way of saying that the group law of `E`
  restricts to `C`; no naturality is required because `LiesIn` is a
  subfunctor automatically.
* `geom_cyclic` is the level-structure condition proper.  Over an
  algebraically closed field the relative points at a geometric point are
  the geometric points of that fibre, and the condition says they meet
  `C` in a cyclic group of order `N`.  In residue characteristic `0` —
  the only case used here — this is equivalent to `C` being finite étale
  with cyclic geometric fibres, so nothing is lost by phrasing it
  pointwise. -/

/-! ### The `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem -/

/-- **A `Γ₀(N)`-structure over a scheme `T`**: an elliptic scheme over
`T` together with a cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N`.

"Elliptic scheme" is spelled out as *abelian scheme of relative dimension
one*: `AbelianSchemeStruct f` already carries properness, smoothness,
geometrically connected fibres, a zero section and a commutative group
law on the functor of points, and `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f` is what
makes the fibres curves rather than abelian varieties of arbitrary
dimension.

This is the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` of Katz–Mazur; its coarse space over
`ℚ` is `Y_0(N)`. -/

  /-- the abelian-scheme structure on `f` -/

  /-- relative dimension one: the fibres are curves -/
  relativeDimensionOne : SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f
  /-- the `Γ₀(N)`-level structure -/
  cyc : CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab N

/-- **`d'` is a base change of `d` along `h : T' ⟶ T`.**

Rather than construct pullbacks and transport structure along them, the
base-change relation is *stated*: a morphism `map` on total spaces making
a cartesian square, compatible with the group law and with the level
structure.  `RelPoint.along map isPullback.w` is the induced map on
relative points, and cartesianness is what makes it a bijection onto the
points over the shifted base point — a fact this development never needs
and therefore never proves.

Taking `h = 𝟙` recovers *isomorphism* of `Γ₀(N)`-data over a fixed base,
which is why a natural transformation out of the moduli problem (in the
sense of `IsCoarseModuliY0.classify_natural` below) is automatically
constant on isomorphism classes. -/

/-! ### The coarse moduli space -/

/-- **`str : Y ⟶ S` is a coarse moduli space for the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli
problem.**

The data is a classifying map sending a `Γ₀(N)`-structure over an
`S`-scheme `T` to a `T`-point of `Y`, natural in cartesian squares, which
is *initial* among all such.  This is Mumford's definition of a
categorical quotient / coarse moduli space, with the bijectivity on
geometric points — the second half of the usual definition — deliberately
omitted: initiality already determines `(Y, classify)` up to unique
isomorphism, which is all that faithfulness of the level statements
requires, and stating the geometric bijection would additionally require
a theory of isomorphisms of `Γ₀(N)`-data that nothing here consumes.

Over `S = Spec ℚ` the unique such `Y` is the modular curve `Y_0(N)`. -/
structure IsCoarseModuliY0 (N : ℕ) {Y S : Scheme.{u}} (str : Y ⟶ S) where
  /-- the classifying map of the moduli problem -/
  classify : ∀ {T : Scheme.{u}} (g : T ⟶ S), Gamma0Datum N T → RelPoint str g
  /-- the classifying map is natural: a base change of data is sent to the

    {d : Gamma0Datum N T}, IsBaseChangeOf h d' d →

  transformation from the moduli problem -/

      (hg : h ≫ g = g') {d' : Gamma0Datum N T'} {d : Gamma0Datum N T},
      IsBaseChangeOf h d' d → c g' d' = RelPoint.pre h hg (c g d)) →
    ∃! u : Y ⟶ Y', u ≫ str' = str ∧
      ∀ {T : Scheme.{u}} (g : T ⟶ S) (d : Gamma0Datum N T),
        (c g d).1 = (classify g d).1 ≫ u

/-- **`Spec ℚ`**, the base of every modular curve considered here. -/
noncomputable abbrev SpecQ : Scheme.{0} := Spec (CommRingCat.of ℚ)

/-- **`Y_0(N)` has no rational point.**

Stated over every coarse moduli space of the `Γ₀(N)`-problem rather than
over a chosen one, so that no choice has to be made before
`exists_coarseModuliY0` is available; by initiality all of them are
canonically `ℚ`-isomorphic, so this is a statement about the genuine
`Y_0(N)`.

`RelPoint str (𝟙 SpecQ)` is by definition the set of sections of
`str : Y ⟶ Spec ℚ`, i.e. `Y(ℚ)`. -/
def Y0HasNoRationalPoint (N : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (Y : Scheme.{0}) (str : Y ⟶ SpecQ),
    IsCoarseModuliY0 N str → IsEmpty (RelPoint str (𝟙 SpecQ))

/-! ### The existence of `Y_0(N)`, and the bridge from Weierstrass curves -/

/-- **The `Γ₀(0)`-moduli problem is supported on the empty scheme** (sorry
leaf).

TRUE, and *elementary* — no modular-curve theory enters.  Suppose
`d : Gamma0Datum 0 T` and `T` had a point `x`.  Embedding the residue field
`κ(x)` into an algebraic closure `K` gives a geometric point
`t : Spec K ⟶ T`, and `d.cyc.geom_cyclic K t` then supplies a relative point
`y` with `addOrderOf y = 0` — that is, of *infinite* order — such that the
points of `d.cyc.C` above `t` are exactly `AddSubgroup.zmultiples y`.  But
`d.cyc.isFinite` makes `d.cyc.ι ≫ d.f` a finite morphism, so the fibre of
`d.cyc.C` over `t` is `Spec` of a finite-dimensional `K`-algebra and has only
finitely many `K`-points, whereas `AddSubgroup.zmultiples y ≃ ℤ` is infinite.
Contradiction, so `T` has no point at all.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE LEAF.  `[Γ₀(N)]` is a moduli problem only for
`N ≥ 1`, so `N = 0` is *outside* the Katz–Mazur theorem cited at
`exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` below.  Splitting it off is what makes that
citation honest: the cited theorem really does prove the `N ≥ 1` half, and
this degenerate half — the only part of `exists_coarseModuliY0` reachable at
this pin — is separated out rather than silently folded into the citation.

REACHABLE.  Formalising the argument needs exactly three things, all
present: stability of `IsFinite` under base change
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite` is an `IsStableUnderBaseChange` morphism
property), affineness of a scheme finite over a field, and the finiteness of
the set of `K`-algebra maps out of an Artinian `K`-algebra. -/

(PROVEN, from `isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero`).

VACUITY AUDIT — read this before consuming it.  By
`isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero` the `Γ₀(0)`-problem has no object over any
nonempty base, so the empty scheme `∅ ⟶ Spec ℚ` is a coarse moduli space
for it, for the cheapest possible reason: every base carrying a datum is
*initial*, so all three clauses of `IsCoarseModuliY0` are equalities of
morphisms out of an initial object.  This carries **no** arithmetic
whatsoever, and in particular `Y0HasNoRationalPoint 0` is NOT thereby a
statement about a modular curve.  It is recorded only so that
`exists_coarseModuliY0` can be stated for every `N` while the citation
below is restricted, correctly, to `N ≥ 1`. -/

## What is cited

Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic Moduli of Elliptic Curves*, Annals of Mathematics
Studies 108, Princeton, 1985:

* **Theorem 6.6.1** (p. 166): *the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` is relatively
  representable over `(Ell)`; it is finite and flat over `(Ell)` of degree
  `(N²/φ(N))·∏_{p ∣ N}(1 − p⁻²)`, and is regular and two-dimensional.*
* **(8.1.1)** (p. 224), the construction of the coarse moduli scheme:
  *let `R` be a ring and `𝒫` a relatively representable moduli problem on
  `(Ell/R)` which is affine over `(Ell/R)`.*  Locally on `R` pick `n ≥ 3`
  invertible and a representable `𝒮` finite étale galois over `(Ell/R)`
  with group `G` — e.g. `𝒮 = [Γ(n)]`, `G = GL₂(ℤ/nℤ)` — and set
  `M(𝒫) = 𝔐(𝒫, 𝒮)/G`.  Katz–Mazur note that this "exists because
  `𝔐(𝒫, 𝒮)` is itself affine", and is independent of the choice of `𝒮`,
  so the local constructions patch.
* **(8.1.3)** (pp. 224–225): the canonical `G`-equivariant *classifying map*
  `S → M(𝒫)` attached to `E/S` with a level `𝒫`-structure, again
  independent of the auxiliary `n`.  This is `classify`, and its
  construction by descent along `S_n → S` is what makes it natural in `S`,
  i.e. `classify_natural`.
* **Lemma 8.1.3.1** (p. 225): for `k` algebraically closed, `M(𝒫)(k)` is
  the set of `k`-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with `𝒫`-structure.

The **initiality** clause is not part of Katz–Mazur's *definition* — they
define `M(𝒫)` by the quotient construction rather than by a universal
property — but it follows from it: `𝔐(𝒫, [Γ(n)])` is affine, so the
quotient of (8.1.1) is `Spec` of the ring of invariants, and that is a
categorical quotient in the category of all schemes (Katz–Mazur Chapter 7,
*Quotients by finite groups*, and its Appendix *Base change for rings of
invariants*; Mumford, *Geometric Invariant Theory*, Ch. 0 §2).  Initiality
of `(Y, classify)` in `IsCoarseModuliY0` is exactly that categorical-quotient
property transported along (8.1.3).

Deligne–Rapoport, *Les schémas de modules de courbes elliptiques*, in
*Modular Functions of One Variable II*, Lecture Notes in Math. 349 (1973),
143–316, is the companion reference and treats the same problem over
`ℤ[1/N]` (no theorem number is quoted here because it was not checked
against the text).

## Why the hypotheses match

* *Base ring.*  `R = ℚ`.  (8.1.1) needs some `n ≥ 3` invertible in `R` only
  locally; over a field of characteristic `0` every `n` is invertible, so
  the construction is global and no patching is needed.  `SpecQ` is
  `Spec ℚ`, so `Y ⟶ SpecQ` is exactly an `R`-scheme.
* *The moduli problem.*  `Gamma0Datum N T` is `[Γ₀(N)]` on `(Ell/ℚ)`:
  `ab` together with `relativeDimensionOne` is an elliptic curve `E/T`, and
  `cyc` is the cyclic subgroup of order `N`.  Theorem 6.6.1 supplies both
  hypotheses (8.1.1) asks for — relative representability, and finiteness
  over `(Ell)`, which gives affineness over `(Ell)`.
* *`N ≥ 1`.*  `[Γ₀(N)]` is defined only for `N ≥ 1`; the level `N = 0` is
  handled separately and degenerately by `exists_coarseModuliY0_zero`.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT: one genuine mismatch, and why it is harmless

Katz–Mazur **(6.7.1)** (p. 167) define a *cyclic group of order `N`* to be
a "finite locally free commutative `S`-group-scheme, of rank `N`, and
cyclic".  `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` above asks instead for a closed subgroup
scheme that is **finite** over the base with **geometric fibres** cyclic of
order `N`; it does **not** ask for flatness.  Over a non-reduced base these
differ, and the gap is real rather than notional:

> Over `T = Spec ℚ[ε]` take `E = E₀ ×_ℚ ℚ[ε]` and a rational point `P` of
> exact order `2` on `E₀`.  Then `C = Spec(ℚ[ε] × ℚ)` — the zero section
> together with the *non-flat* thickening `ℚ[ε] ↠ ℚ` of the `P`-component
> of `E[2]` — is closed in `E`, finite over `T`, contains the zero section,
> and is closed under the group law (`P + P = 0`), and its unique geometric
> fibre is `ℤ/2`.  So it is a `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` of order `2` that is
> not a Katz–Mazur `[Γ₀(2)]`-structure.

So the moduli problem here is a priori *larger* than `[Γ₀(N)]`, and the
cited theorem does not literally apply to it.  It does apply after one
extra step, which a successor closing this node must supply: over a
`ℚ`-scheme `E[N]` is finite étale, the support of such a `C` is open and
closed in `E[N]` (its geometric fibres all have exactly `N` points), and
the corresponding open-and-closed subgroup scheme is a canonical finite
locally free "flatification" `C ⊆ C^♭ ⊆ E[N]` with the same geometric
fibres, formed compatibly with base change.  Flatification is therefore a
natural retraction of this moduli problem onto `[Γ₀(N)]`, and a natural
transformation out of one is the same thing as a natural transformation out
of the other — so the two problems have the same coarse space and the
citation transfers.

This mismatch is recorded rather than repaired because repairing it means
adding a flat variant of `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` to the interface, which is
a change to the moduli problem itself and not to this node.

## Why it is IRREDUCIBLE at this pin

Surveyed 2026-07-26: `Mathlib` has no modular curve, no modular polynomial,
no moduli stack, no coarse-space existence theorem, no geometric invariant
theory and no quotient of a scheme by a finite group; `~/cs/FLT` takes the
weaker Mazur torsion bound as a bare `axiom`.  Every route to this
statement — Katz–Mazur (8.1.1) via `[Γ(n)]`-rigidification and quotients,
Deligne–Rapoport via stacks, or the classical construction of `Y_0(N)` as
the normalisation of `Φ_N(X, Y) = 0` in `𝔸¹ × 𝔸¹` with classifying map
`(E, C) ↦ (j(E), j(E/C))` — needs a theory that does not exist here. -/

/-- **A Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` of `E(ℚ̄)` is a

This is the bridge between the elementary phrasing used in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` — a Weierstrass curve over `ℚ` and a point
of order `N` over `ℚ̄` generating a Galois-stable subgroup — and the
moduli problem.  TRUE, and it folds together two independent missing
theories:

* the projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
  `Spec ℚ`: `Mathlib` has `WeierstrassCurve`, `IsElliptic`, and the group
  law on the points over a field, but not the elliptic curve as a *group
  scheme*, so `AbelianSchemeStruct` for it must be constructed;
* Galois descent for the finite subgroup: `⟨g⟩ ⊆ E(ℚ̄)` is finite and
  Galois-stable, and in characteristic `0` such a subgroup is exactly the
  set of geometric points of a unique finite étale closed subgroup scheme
  `C ⊆ E` over `ℚ` — this is the equivalence between finite étale
  `ℚ`-schemes and finite `Γ_ℚ`-sets.

`hstable` is verbatim the stability hypothesis carried by the twelve
level nodes, so no reformulation happens at the boundary. -/

If `Y_0(N)` has no rational point but some elliptic curve over `ℚ` has a
Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N`, then the classifying map
produces a rational point of `Y_0(N)` — a contradiction.  This is the one
place where the three sorried inputs above meet, and it is what the
twelve level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` call. -/

/-! ### The twelve levels of Kenku's non-prime-power determination

Each statement below is the level `N` of the Mazur–Kenku classification,
restated as a claim about the rational points of the modular curve
`Y_0(N)`.  The levels `N` for which `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly

`1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163`

(Mazur, *Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal*, Publ. Math. IHÉS 47
(1977); *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math. 44 (1978);
Kenku's series, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 85 (1979) and 87
(1980), J. London Math. Soc. (2) 22 (1980) and 23 (1981), J. Number
Theory 15 (1982)), and none of the levels below is in that list.

All of them are IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason: each
is a determination of the rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and
neither `J_0(N)`, nor its Mordell–Weil group, nor Chabauty–Coleman exists
in this development.  See the module docstring for the three subtrees
that are needed. -/

/-- **`Y_0(pq)(ℚ) = ∅` for `pq` a product of two distinct primes outside
`{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}`** (sorry node — the uniform, squarefree part of
Kenku's determination).

Those five products are exactly the semiprimes in the Mazur–Kenku list.
The statement is uniform but its content is finite: by Mazur's prime
node both `p` and `q` lie in `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43, 67,
163}`, so `61` of the `66` unordered pairs need excluding — among them
`X_0(35)` and `X_0(39)` (Kenku 1979), `X_0(65)` and `X_0(91)` (Kenku
1980).  Already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`. -/
