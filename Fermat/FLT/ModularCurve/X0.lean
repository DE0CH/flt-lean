# `Y_0(N)` as a coarse moduli space over `ℚ`

This module supplies the **missing modular-curve layer** behind Kenku's
half of the Mazur–Kenku isogeny classification, i.e. behind the twelve
level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean`
(`WeierstrassCurve.not_cyclicIsogeny_prod_two_primes`,
`…_twenty`, `…_twentyFour`, `…_twentyEight`, `…_thirty`, `…_thirtySix`,
`…_fortyTwo`, `…_fortyFive`, `…_fifty`, `…_fiftyFour`, `…_sixtyThree`,
`…_seventyFive`).

## Why this layer has to exist at all

Every one of those twelve statements is, mathematically, the assertion

> the modular curve `Y_0(N)` has no `ℚ`-rational point,

for a level `N` of genus `≥ 1` (`20, 24, 36` have genus `1`; `28, 50`
genus `2`; `30, 45` genus `3`; `54` genus `4`; `42, 63, 75` genus `5`;
and already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`).  A survey of the pin on 2026-07-26
found **no modular curves anywhere**: `grep ModularCurve` over the whole
of `.lake/packages/mathlib` returns nothing,
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/ModularForms/` contains modular *forms* rather than
curves or Jacobians, and `~/cs/FLT` takes the strictly weaker Mazur
torsion bound as a bare `axiom` (`FLT/Assumptions/Mazur.lean`).  So the
twelve statements could not even be *phrased* as what they are; they were
phrased instead as statements about a Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of an
elliptic curve over `ℚ`, which is the moduli *input*, not the modular
curve.

What this module does is exactly that rephrasing, and nothing more: it
writes down the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem and its coarse moduli space, and
restates the twelve levels as `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.  The mathematical content
of the twelve nodes is untouched — it is *relocated* onto an object where
the Kenku/Ogg arguments (Mordell–Weil ranks of `J_0(N)`, Chabauty) can
one day be run.

## Design: Yoneda, following `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`

The elliptic scheme is `Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct` from
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean` — a commutative group structure on the
functor of points, plus properness, smoothness and geometrically
connected fibres — together with `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1`, which is
what cuts abelian schemes down to elliptic curves.  Presenting the group
law through the functor of points rather than as a morphism
`E ×_T E ⟶ E` means no chosen pullbacks and no monoidal structure on
`Over T` are needed, which is the only reason this is writable at this
pin at all.

Three consequences shape everything below.

* **The level structure is a closed subgroup scheme, not a subfunctor.**
  A `Γ₀(N)`-structure is a finite closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`, and
  membership of a relative point in it is *factoring through the closed
  immersion* (`RelPoint.LiesIn`).  Taking a bare subfunctor of the
  functor of points instead would be strictly weaker — an arbitrary
  subfunctor need not be representable, the moduli problem would then be
  larger than the true one, and its coarse space larger than `Y_0(N)`,
  which is precisely the way a level statement could silently become
  false.  Representability is bought here by carrying `C` as an actual
  scheme.

* **Base change is stated relationally, never constructed**
  (`IsBaseChangeOf`).  The moduli "functor" is only a functor up to
  isomorphism, so instead of forming pullbacks and transporting the
  group structure — expensive, and unnecessary — the naturality axiom
  quantifies over cartesian squares.  Note that this *also* delivers
  isomorphism-invariance for free: an isomorphic datum over the same base
  is a base change along the identity, so a natural transformation out of
  the moduli problem is automatically constant on isomorphism classes,
  which is what makes "initial among such" the coarse space of the
  moduli *stack* rather than of some rigidified variant.

* **`Y_0(N)`, not `X_0(N)`.**  The affine coarse space suffices, so no
  compactification, no cusps and no genus theory are needed here: the
  statement "`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists only of cusps" is literally
  "`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`".  This is a deliberate scope cut — it removes an
  entire missing theory (the smooth compactification of a coarse moduli
  space, and the rationality of its cusps) from the critical path without
  weakening any statement.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT

There are exactly three sorried claim-shapes here, and each is true:

1. `exists_coarseModuliY0 N` — the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem over `ℚ` admits
   a coarse moduli space.  TRUE: this is the classical existence
   statement for `Y_0(N)` (Deligne–Rapoport, Katz–Mazur; or classically
   via the `j`-line and the modular polynomial).

2. `nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable` — an elliptic curve over `ℚ` with a
   Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` in `E(ℚ̄)` gives a
   `Γ₀(N)`-datum over `Spec ℚ`.  TRUE, and this is where two further
   missing theories are folded together and left for a successor: the
   projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
   `Spec ℚ`, and the finite étale closed subgroup scheme attached to a
   Galois-stable finite subgroup of `E(ℚ̄)` (char `0`, so Galois descent
   for finite étale schemes is the whole content).

3. `Y0HasNoRationalPoint N` at the twelve levels.  TRUE: the levels `N`
   with `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67,
   163}` (Mazur 1978, Kenku 1979–1982), and none of `20, 24, 28, 30, 36,
   42, 45, 50, 54, 63, 75` — nor any product of two distinct primes
   outside `{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}` — lies in that list.

*Amended 2026-07-26.*  Shape 3 no longer covers the semiprime family
directly: `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prod_two_primes` is now PROVEN, and its
content sits in the two nodes `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime` (Mazur 1978,
the only UNIFORM input in the module) and
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes` (Kenku, `61` explicit
levels).  Two further sorried shapes were introduced by that
decomposition, both about the degeneracy map `Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` for
`M ∣ N`, and both TRUE:

4. `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofDvd` — the sub-level structure `C[M] ⊆ C`,
   i.e. the kernel of `[N / M]` on `C`.

5. `liesIn_ofDvd_iff` — that kernel commutes with base change.

The lemma they support, `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd`, is checked
against the ground truth by observing that the Mazur–Kenku list is
DIVISOR-CLOSED; see its docstring.

**Why the interface must pin `Y` down, and does.** A weaker interface —
say, a smooth projective curve over `ℚ` with a bijection on `ℚ̄`-points
— would be satisfied by `ℙ¹` for a cheap reason, and then
`Y0HasNoRationalPoint 20` would be FALSE rather than open, which is worse
than leaving the node untouched.  What rules that out is the *universal
property*: `IsCoarseModuliY0` asks for initiality among all `ℚ`-schemes
receiving a natural transformation from the moduli problem, and an
initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism.  So any `Y` satisfying
this interface is `ℚ`-isomorphic to the genuine `Y_0(N)`, and (3) is a
statement about the genuine `Y_0(N)`.

## What is NOT here, and is the next decomposition

This module deliberately stops at the coarse moduli space.  It does not
build, and the twelve level nodes still need:

* `J_0(N)` and its Mordell–Weil group (`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` is proved by
  bounding `J_0(N)(ℚ)`);
* the Hecke algebra and the Eisenstein / winding quotient, which is what
  supplies the rank-`0` input;
* for the higher-genus levels, Chabauty–Coleman.

Those are three independent subtrees, none of which exists at this pin.

/-! ### Relative points and a closed subscheme -/

/-- **A relative point lies in a subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`** when it factors
through `ι`.

For `ι` a closed immersion this is the functor-of-points description of
the closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`: it is a *subfunctor* of the functor of
points of `E` by construction (precomposition preserves factoring), so no
naturality axiom is needed for it anywhere below. -/
def RelPoint.LiesIn {E T C : Scheme.{u}} {f : E ⟶ T} (ι : C ⟶ E)
    {T' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T' ⟶ T} (x : RelPoint f g) : Prop :=
  ∃ y : T' ⟶ C, y ≫ ι = x.1

/-- **Transport of a relative point along a morphism lying over the
base.** If `map : E' ⟶ E` fits in a commuting square over `h : T' ⟶ T`
then a `T''`-point of `E'` over `g : T'' ⟶ T'` becomes a `T''`-point of
`E` over `g ≫ h`.

When the square is *cartesian* this map is the canonical identification
of the points of the base change with the points of `E` over the shifted
base point; it is used below only through cartesian squares, but nothing
in its definition needs that. -/
def RelPoint.along {E' T' E T : Scheme.{u}} {f' : E' ⟶ T'} {f : E ⟶ T}
    {h : T' ⟶ T} (map : E' ⟶ E) (hw : f' ≫ h = map ≫ f)

    RelPoint f (g ≫ h) :=
  ⟨x.1 ≫ map, by rw [Category.assoc, ← hw, ← Category.assoc, x.2]⟩

/-! ### Cyclic subgroup schemes of order `N` -/

/-- **A cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N` of an abelian scheme.**

The data is a closed subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`, finite over the base, whose
relative points form a subgroup of the relative points of `E` at every
base point, and whose geometric fibres are cyclic of order exactly `N`.

Three remarks on the axioms.

* Closedness and finiteness are what make this a subgroup *scheme*
  rather than a subfunctor; see the module docstring for why that
  distinction is load-bearing for faithfulness.
* The subgroup conditions are stated at *every* base point `g : T' ⟶ T`,
  which is the functor-of-points way of saying that the group law of `E`
  restricts to `C`; no naturality is required because `LiesIn` is a
  subfunctor automatically.
* `geom_cyclic` is the level-structure condition proper.  Over an
  algebraically closed field the relative points at a geometric point are
  the geometric points of that fibre, and the condition says they meet
  `C` in a cyclic group of order `N`.  In residue characteristic `0` —
  the only case used here — this is equivalent to `C` being finite étale
  with cyclic geometric fibres, so nothing is lost by phrasing it
  pointwise. -/

/-! ### The `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem -/

/-- **A `Γ₀(N)`-structure over a scheme `T`**: an elliptic scheme over
`T` together with a cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N`.

"Elliptic scheme" is spelled out as *abelian scheme of relative dimension
one*: `AbelianSchemeStruct f` already carries properness, smoothness,
geometrically connected fibres, a zero section and a commutative group
law on the functor of points, and `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f` is what
makes the fibres curves rather than abelian varieties of arbitrary
dimension.

This is the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` of Katz–Mazur; its coarse space over
`ℚ` is `Y_0(N)`. -/

  relativeDimensionOne : SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f
  /-- the `Γ₀(N)`-level structure -/
  cyc : CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab N

/-- **`d'` is a base change of `d` along `h : T' ⟶ T`.**

Rather than construct pullbacks and transport structure along them, the
base-change relation is *stated*: a morphism `map` on total spaces making
a cartesian square, compatible with the group law and with the level
structure.  `RelPoint.along map isPullback.w` is the induced map on
relative points, and cartesianness is what makes it a bijection onto the
points over the shifted base point — a fact this development never needs
and therefore never proves.

Taking `h = 𝟙` recovers *isomorphism* of `Γ₀(N)`-data over a fixed base,
which is why a natural transformation out of the moduli problem (in the
sense of `IsCoarseModuliY0.classify_natural` below) is automatically
constant on isomorphism classes. -/

/-! ### The coarse moduli space -/

/-- **`str : Y ⟶ S` is a coarse moduli space for the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli
problem.**

The data is a classifying map sending a `Γ₀(N)`-structure over an
`S`-scheme `T` to a `T`-point of `Y`, natural in cartesian squares, which
is *initial* among all such.  This is Mumford's definition of a
categorical quotient / coarse moduli space, with the bijectivity on
geometric points — the second half of the usual definition — deliberately
omitted: initiality already determines `(Y, classify)` up to unique
isomorphism, which is all that faithfulness of the level statements
requires, and stating the geometric bijection would additionally require
a theory of isomorphisms of `Γ₀(N)`-data that nothing here consumes.

Over `S = Spec ℚ` the unique such `Y` is the modular curve `Y_0(N)`. -/
structure IsCoarseModuliY0 (N : ℕ) {Y S : Scheme.{u}} (str : Y ⟶ S) where
  /-- the classifying map of the moduli problem -/

/-- **`Y_0(N)` has no rational point.**

Stated over every coarse moduli space of the `Γ₀(N)`-problem rather than
over a chosen one, so that no choice has to be made before
`exists_coarseModuliY0` is available; by initiality all of them are
canonically `ℚ`-isomorphic, so this is a statement about the genuine
`Y_0(N)`.

`RelPoint str (𝟙 SpecQ)` is by definition the set of sections of
`str : Y ⟶ Spec ℚ`, i.e. `Y(ℚ)`. -/

/-! ### The existence of `Y_0(N)`, and the bridge from Weierstrass curves -/

/-- **Existence of the coarse moduli space `Y_0(N)`** (sorry node).

TRUE, and classical: the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` over `ℚ` is a separated
Deligne–Mumford stack of finite type, hence has a coarse moduli space
(Deligne–Rapoport, *Les schémas de modules de courbes elliptiques*,
Antwerp II, 1973; Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic moduli of elliptic curves*,
1985).  Classically one may instead construct it by hand as the
normalisation of the plane curve cut out by the modular polynomial
`Φ_N(X, Y)` inside `𝔸¹ × 𝔸¹`, with the classifying map
`(E, C) ↦ (j(E), j(E/C))`.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin: no modular curve, no modular polynomial,
no moduli stack and no coarse-space existence theorem exists anywhere in
`Mathlib` or in `~/cs/FLT` (surveyed 2026-07-26). -/

/-- **A Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N` of `E(ℚ̄)` is a
`Γ₀(N)`-structure over `Spec ℚ`** (sorry node).

This is the bridge between the elementary phrasing used in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` — a Weierstrass curve over `ℚ` and a point
of order `N` over `ℚ̄` generating a Galois-stable subgroup — and the
moduli problem.  TRUE, and it folds together two independent missing
theories:

* the projective Weierstrass model of `E` as an abelian scheme over
  `Spec ℚ`: `Mathlib` has `WeierstrassCurve`, `IsElliptic`, and the group
  law on the points over a field, but not the elliptic curve as a *group
  scheme*, so `AbelianSchemeStruct` for it must be constructed;
* Galois descent for the finite subgroup: `⟨g⟩ ⊆ E(ℚ̄)` is finite and
  Galois-stable, and in characteristic `0` such a subgroup is exactly the
  set of geometric points of a unique finite étale closed subgroup scheme
  `C ⊆ E` over `ℚ` — this is the equivalence between finite étale
  `ℚ`-schemes and finite `Γ_ℚ`-sets.

level nodes, so no reformulation happens at the boundary. -/

/-- **The consumption rule of this module.**

If `Y_0(N)` has no rational point but some elliptic curve over `ℚ` has a
Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N`, then the classifying map
produces a rational point of `Y_0(N)` — a contradiction.  This is the one
place where the three sorried inputs above meet, and it is what the

/-! ### Functoriality in the level, and the descent along divisors

The twelve level nodes below are twelve *separate* determinations of the
rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and nothing about that is
uniform.  What IS uniform, and is built here, is the degeneracy map

`Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` for `M ∣ N`, `(E, C) ↦ (E, C[M])`,

together with its consequence `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd`.  That single
lemma is what turns the one *infinite* family among the twelve —
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_prod_two_primes`, quantified over all pairs of
distinct primes — into a finite list of levels, by letting Mazur's prime
theorem be applied to a prime divisor of the level rather than to the
level itself.  It is stated here, once, rather than reproved inside each
level node.

**Why it is stated over the coarse space and not over data.**  A rational
point of `Y_0(N)` need not come from a `Γ₀(N)`-datum over `ℚ` — that is
exactly what "coarse" costs — so the map on points cannot be defined
pointwise.  It is obtained instead from the *universal property* of
`Y_0(N)`: `d ↦ classify_M (d.ofDvd)` is a natural transformation from the
`Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem to `Y_0(M)`, and initiality produces the morphism
`u : Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` over `ℚ` through which every rational point is
pushed.  This is the only place in the module where `universal` is used,
and it is why that field was stated. -/

/-- **The sub-level structure `C[M] ⊆ C` of a cyclic subgroup scheme of
order `N`, for `M ∣ N`** (sorry node).

TRUE, and it is the kernel of multiplication by `N / M` on `C`: over a
base where `C` is finite étale with geometric fibres cyclic of order `N`,
the fibres of that kernel are the unique order-`M` subgroups, so the
kernel is again finite, closed in `C` — hence closed in `E` — and cyclic
of order exactly `M` on geometric fibres.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason as
`nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable`: it needs the kernel of an endomorphism
of a finite flat group scheme as a *scheme*, i.e. a fibre product, and
the composite of closed immersions — none of which is packaged for the
functor-of-points presentation used here.

`hN` excludes `N = 0`.  It is not cosmetic: `N = 0` asks the geometric
fibres of a scheme FINITE over the base to be infinite cyclic, so
`CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab 0` is in fact vacuous — but vacuous for a
reason (finiteness of `ι ≫ f`) that this development does not have the
machinery to exploit, and without `hN` the statement would read as the
false claim that an infinite cyclic group has a subgroup of order `M`. -/

/-- **The degeneracy map on `Γ₀`-data, `(E, C) ↦ (E, C[M])` for `M ∣ N`.**

The elliptic scheme is untouched — same total space, same structure
morphism, same abelian-scheme structure, same relative dimension — and
only the level structure is cut down by `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofDvd`.
Writing it this way is what makes `IsBaseChangeOf.ofDvd` below carry the
*same* `map` and the *same* cartesian square, so that the only thing left
to check there is the level-structure axiom. -/

/-- **The degeneracy map is compatible with base change, on the level

TRUE: `C'[M]` is the kernel of `N / M` on `C'`, `C' = C ×_T T'` as a
subgroup scheme of `E'` by `hb.liesIn_iff`, and forming the kernel of an
endomorphism commutes with base change.  So a relative point of `E'` lies
in `C'[M]` exactly when its image lies in `C[M]`.

This is the *only* axiom of `IsBaseChangeOf` that the degeneracy map does
not inherit verbatim from `hb`, because the other four mention only data
that `Gamma0Datum.ofDvd` copies unchanged. -/

/-- **Descent along divisors of the level: if `Y_0(M)(ℚ) = ∅` and
`M ∣ N` then `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`** (PROVEN).

This is the uniform half of every composite level statement.  The proof
is the universal property and nothing else: `d ↦ classify_M (d.ofDvd)` is
a natural transformation from the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem to a coarse
space of the `Γ₀(M)`-problem, so initiality of `Y_0(N)` yields a
`ℚ`-morphism `u : Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)`, and composing a rational point of
`Y_0(N)` with `u` gives one of `Y_0(M)`.

**Sanity check against the ground truth.**  The contrapositive says the
set of levels with a rational point is closed under divisors, and the
Mazur–Kenku list `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163}` is indeed
divisor-closed: `27 ↦ 9, 3`; `25 ↦ 5`; `21 ↦ 3, 7`; `18 ↦ 9, 6, 3, 2`;
`16 ↦ 8, 4, 2`; `12 ↦ 6, 4, 3, 2`, and every proper divisor of a level
`≤ 19` is `≤ 19`.  The four large primes `37, 43, 67, 163` have no proper
divisor but `1`.  So this lemma is consistent with the classification,
which is the check that matters — a level statement that contradicted it
would be false rather than open. -/

These are exactly the primes in the Mazur–Kenku list
`{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163}`.  The elliptic-curve-side
statement carrying the same list is

cannot be used here. -/

/-- **Mazur's rational isogenies of prime degree, on the modular curve**
(sorry node): `Y_0(p)(ℚ) = ∅` for every prime `p` outside
`mazurIsogenyPrimes`.

TRUE — this is Mazur, *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math.
44 (1978), Theorem 1, in its modular-curve form: `X_0(p)(ℚ)` consists of
the two cusps for every prime `p ∉ {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43,
67, 163}`.

**This is the statement that makes the semiprime family finite**, via
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd` applied to `p ∣ p * q`; it is the only
uniform input available, since every other tool here is a per-level
computation.

Relation to what is already in the tree.  The elliptic-curve phrasing,
`WeierstrassCurve.prime_mem_cyclicIsogenyDegrees`, is PROVEN in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` from the single leaf
`WeierstrassCurve.not_isogenyCharacter_of_prime_ge_twentyThree`.  That
module *imports* this one, so the implication cannot be used in this
direction, and in any case the modular-curve statement is genuinely
STRONGER: it rules out rational points of the coarse moduli space, which
need not be represented by a pair `(E, C)` defined over `ℚ`.  The two
should be reconciled once the layer below exists — the honest route is to
prove this node and *derive* the elliptic-curve one from it through
`false_of_stable_of_y0HasNoRationalPoint`, which is exactly the shape
`MazurTorsion.lean` already uses for the twelve composite levels.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin: Mazur's argument is the Eisenstein ideal in the
Hecke algebra acting on `J_0(p)`, none of which exists here.  See the
module docstring for the three missing subtrees. -/

`mazurIsogenyPrimes` with `p * q ∉ {6, 10, 14, 15, 21}`.

TRUE: the semiprimes in the Mazur–Kenku list are exactly `6, 10, 14, 15,
21`, so every other product of two distinct primes is absent from it.

**This node is finite, and that is the whole point of the decomposition
above.**  `mazurIsogenyPrimes` has `12` elements, so there are `66`
unordered pairs; five of them give the excluded products; `61` remain,
the smallest being `2 · 11 = 22` and the largest `67 · 163 = 10921`.
Sources: Kenku, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. **85** (1979) 21–23

**WHAT THIS NODE STILL NEEDS, and why it is a subtree rather than a
leaf.**  Every one of the `61` pairs has `X_0(pq)` of genus `≥ 2` —
already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`, and no semiprime level has genus `1`
(the genus-`1` levels are `11, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 32, 36,
49`, of which only `14, 15, 21` are semiprimes and all three are
excluded).  So none of them is an elliptic-curve rank computation, and
each is settled by one of:

* **rank `0` plus reduction** — `J_0(pq)(ℚ)` finite, Abel–Jacobi
  `X_0(pq) ↪ J_0(pq)` at a rational cusp, injectivity of reduction at a
  good prime `ℓ`, and then `#X_0(pq)(ℚ) ≤ #X_0(pq)(𝔽_ℓ) = #cusps`;
* **Chabauty–Coleman** for the pairs where the rank is positive but
  below the genus.

Neither is stated as a leaf here, deliberately.  Both are statements
about `X_0(pq)` — the SMOOTH COMPACTIFICATION, its cusps, its Jacobian,
and an integral model to reduce along — and this module stops at the
affine coarse space `Y_0(N)` precisely to keep that out of the critical
path.  Writing either criterion against `Y_0(N)` alone would have to
smuggle the point count into a hypothesis, since rank `0` by itself gives
FINITENESS of `X_0(N)(ℚ)` and never emptiness of `Y_0(N)(ℚ)`; the step
from finite to empty *is* the cusp count.  A criterion whose hypothesis
is equivalent to its conclusion would be a false economy, so the honest
next decomposition is the compactification interface first
(`X_0(N) ⊇ Y_0(N)` proper smooth, with its rational cusps), then
`J_0(N)` as an abelian scheme, and only then the two criteria. -/

/-! ### The twelve levels of Kenku's non-prime-power determination

Each statement below is the level `N` of the Mazur–Kenku classification,
restated as a claim about the rational points of the modular curve
`Y_0(N)`.  The levels `N` for which `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly

`1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163`

(Mazur, *Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal*, Publ. Math. IHÉS 47
(1977); *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math. 44 (1978);
Kenku's series, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 85 (1979) and 87
(1980), J. London Math. Soc. (2) 22 (1980) and 23 (1981), J. Number
Theory 15 (1982)), and none of the levels below is in that list.

All of them are IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason: each
is a determination of the rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and
neither `J_0(N)`, nor its Mordell–Weil group, nor Chabauty–Coleman exists
in this development.  See the module docstring for the three subtrees
that are needed. -/

/-- **`Y_0(pq)(ℚ) = ∅` for `pq` a product of two distinct primes outside
`{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}`** (sorry node — the uniform, squarefree part of
Kenku's determination).

Those five products are exactly the semiprimes in the Mazur–Kenku list.
The statement is uniform but its content is finite: by Mazur's prime
node both `p` and `q` lie in `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43, 67,
163}`, so `61` of the `66` unordered pairs need excluding — among them
`X_0(35)` and `X_0(39)` (Kenku 1979), `X_0(65)` and `X_0(91)` (Kenku
1980).  Already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`.

PROVEN 2026-07-26, as exactly that reduction from an infinite family to a
finite one.  The case split is on whether the two prime divisors of the
level lie in `mazurIsogenyPrimes`:

* if `p` does not, then `Y_0(p)(ℚ) = ∅` by `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime`,
  and `p ∣ p * q` carries it up to the level by
  `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd` — this is where the infinitude goes;
* symmetrically for `q`;
* if both do, the level is one of the `61` residual products and the
  content is `y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes`.

So the mathematics is relocated onto two nodes — Mazur's prime theorem
and Kenku's finite check — and the quantifier over all pairs of distinct
primes is discharged here by the degeneracy map `Y_0(pq) ⟶ Y_0(p)`. -/
