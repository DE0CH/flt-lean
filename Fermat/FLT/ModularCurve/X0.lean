# `Y_0(N)` as a coarse moduli space over `ℚ`

This module supplies the **missing modular-curve layer** behind Kenku's
half of the Mazur–Kenku isogeny classification, i.e. behind the twelve
level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean`
(`WeierstrassCurve.not_cyclicIsogeny_prod_two_primes`,
`…_twenty`, `…_twentyFour`, `…_twentyEight`, `…_thirty`, `…_thirtySix`,
`…_fortyTwo`, `…_fortyFive`, `…_fifty`, `…_fiftyFour`, `…_sixtyThree`,
`…_seventyFive`).

## Why this layer has to exist at all

Every one of those twelve statements is, mathematically, the assertion

> the modular curve `Y_0(N)` has no `ℚ`-rational point,

for a level `N` of genus `≥ 1` (`20, 24, 36` have genus `1`; `28, 50`
genus `2`; `30, 45` genus `3`; `54` genus `4`; `42, 63, 75` genus `5`;
and already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`).  A survey of the pin on 2026-07-26
found **no modular curves anywhere**: `grep ModularCurve` over the whole
of `.lake/packages/mathlib` returns nothing,
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/ModularForms/` contains modular *forms* rather than
curves or Jacobians, and `~/cs/FLT` takes the strictly weaker Mazur
torsion bound as a bare `axiom` (`FLT/Assumptions/Mazur.lean`).  So the
twelve statements could not even be *phrased* as what they are; they were
phrased instead as statements about a Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of an
elliptic curve over `ℚ`, which is the moduli *input*, not the modular
curve.

What this module does is exactly that rephrasing, and nothing more: it
writes down the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem and its coarse moduli space, and
restates the twelve levels as `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.  The mathematical content
of the twelve nodes is untouched — it is *relocated* onto an object where
the Kenku/Ogg arguments (Mordell–Weil ranks of `J_0(N)`, Chabauty) can
one day be run.

## Design: Yoneda, following `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`

The elliptic scheme is `Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct` from
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean` — a commutative group structure on the
functor of points, plus properness, smoothness and geometrically
connected fibres — together with `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1`, which is
what cuts abelian schemes down to elliptic curves.  Presenting the group
law through the functor of points rather than as a morphism
`E ×_T E ⟶ E` means no chosen pullbacks and no monoidal structure on
`Over T` are needed, which is the only reason this is writable at this
pin at all.

Three consequences shape everything below.

* **The level structure is a closed subgroup scheme, not a subfunctor.**
  A `Γ₀(N)`-structure is a finite closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`, and
  membership of a relative point in it is *factoring through the closed
  immersion* (`RelPoint.LiesIn`).  Taking a bare subfunctor of the
  functor of points instead would be strictly weaker — an arbitrary
  subfunctor need not be representable, the moduli problem would then be
  larger than the true one, and its coarse space larger than `Y_0(N)`,
  which is precisely the way a level statement could silently become
  false.  Representability is bought here by carrying `C` as an actual
  scheme.

* **Base change is stated relationally, never constructed**
  (`IsBaseChangeOf`).  The moduli "functor" is only a functor up to
  isomorphism, so instead of forming pullbacks and transporting the
  group structure — expensive, and unnecessary — the naturality axiom
  quantifies over cartesian squares.  Note that this *also* delivers
  isomorphism-invariance for free: an isomorphic datum over the same base
  is a base change along the identity, so a natural transformation out of
  the moduli problem is automatically constant on isomorphism classes,
  which is what makes "initial among such" the coarse space of the
  moduli *stack* rather than of some rigidified variant.

* **`Y_0(N)`, not `X_0(N)`, in the STATEMENTS.**  The level statements
  are about the affine coarse space: "`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists only of
  cusps" is literally "`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`", and phrasing them affinely
  keeps the cusps out of the *interface* consumed by
  `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean`.

  It does NOT keep them out of the *proofs*, and an earlier version of
  this docstring claimed otherwise.  Rank `0` bounds `#X_0(N)(ℚ)`; only
  the count of rational cusps turns that bound into emptiness of
  `Y_0(N)(ℚ)`.  So the compactification is on the critical path after
  all, and it is built below (`IsX0Compactification`, `IsJacobianOf`,
  `card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian`) — used by the seven single-prime
  levels, and stated so that the four sieve levels can reuse it.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT

There are four claim-shapes here, and each is true.  Shapes 1 and 2 are
now proven, each over strictly fewer sorried inputs than the node it
replaced; shape 3 is now proven at seven of its eleven named levels over
shape 4, and shape 4 is the compactification layer:

1. `exists_coarseModuliY0 N` — the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem over `ℚ` admits
   a coarse moduli space.  TRUE: this is the classical existence
   statement for `Y_0(N)` (Deligne–Rapoport, Katz–Mazur; or classically
   via the `j`-line and the modular polynomial).  It is now PROVEN from a
   split of the level: `exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` (`N ≥ 1`) carries
   the citation — Katz–Mazur Theorem 6.6.1 and (8.1.1) — and
   `exists_coarseModuliY0_zero` disposes of `N = 0`, which lies outside
   their theorem, from `isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero` — itself PROVEN
   2026-07-26, so the `N = 0` half of this shape is now sorry-free
   outright and the citation at `_of_pos` is the only remaining input.

   The audit at `exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` used to record one place
   where this module's level structure was *weaker* than Katz–Mazur's,
   and hence one place where the moduli problem here was strictly larger
   than `[Γ₀(N)]` and the citation did not literally apply.  **That is
   repaired as of 2026-07-26**: `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` now carries a
   `flat` field, so the level structure is finite *locally free* in
   Katz–Mazur's sense (6.7.1) and the two moduli problems agree over
   `(Ell/ℚ)`.  See the docstring of `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` for the
   `Spec ℚ[ε]` counterexample that the field excludes.

2. The bridge from the Weierstrass phrasing to the moduli problem.  This
   was one node, `nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable`; it is now PROVEN
   (2026-07-26) from the two independent missing theories it had folded
   together, which are the sorry nodes in its place:

   * `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass` — the projective Weierstrass
     model of `E` as an elliptic scheme over `Spec ℚ`, together with the
     `Γ_ℚ`-equivariant additive identification of its geometric fibre
     with `E(ℚ̄)`.  TRUE: the smooth plane cubic with the chord–tangent
     law.  The larger of the two.
   * `exists_cyclicSubgroupOfOrder_of_galoisStable` — a Galois-stable
     cyclic subgroup of the geometric points of *any* abelian scheme
     over `Spec ℚ` is cut out by a closed cyclic subgroup scheme.  TRUE:
     in characteristic `0` this is Galois descent for finite étale
     schemes, i.e. the reduced induced structure on a finite
     `Γ_ℚ`-stable set of closed points.

3. `Y0HasNoRationalPoint N` at the twelve levels.  TRUE: the levels `N`
   with `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67,
   163}` (Mazur 1978, Kenku 1979–1982), and none of `20, 24, 28, 30, 36,
   42, 45, 50, 54, 63, 75` — nor any product of two distinct primes
   outside `{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}` — lies in that list.

4. The compactification layer: `X_0(N) ⊇ Y_0(N)` with its finite cusp
   locus, `J_0(N)` by its Albanese universal property, the rank-`0`
   input, the Eichler–Shimura counts, and the reduction bound.  TRUE —
   each of its five leaves carries its own justification, and each is a
   named classical theorem rather than a repackaging of its consumer.
   The one hypothesis worth flagging is positivity of the genus, carried
   inside `HasRankZeroJacobian`: without it the reduction bound is FALSE
   at `N = 1`, where `X_0(1) = ℙ¹` has a trivial Jacobian and infinitely
   many rational points.

*Amended 2026-07-26.*  Shape 3 no longer covers the semiprime family
directly: `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prod_two_primes` is now PROVEN, and its
content sits in the two nodes `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime` (Mazur 1978,
the only UNIFORM input in the module) and
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes` (Kenku, `61` explicit
levels).  Two further sorried shapes were introduced by that
decomposition, both about the degeneracy map `Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` for
`M ∣ N`, and both TRUE:

4. `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofDvd` — the sub-level structure `C[M] ⊆ C`,
   i.e. the `M`-torsion of `C`, the kernel of `[M]`.

5. `liesIn_ofDvd_iff` — that kernel commutes with base change.

*Amended again 2026-07-26.*  Shapes 4 and 5 are both now PROVEN, over a
single geometric leaf that replaces them:

6. `exists_torsionSubscheme` — for a cyclic subgroup scheme `C` of order
   `N` and ANY `M`, the `M`-torsion subfunctor of `C` is cut out by a
   closed subscheme of `E`, finite over the base.  TRUE: `C` is a finite
   flat commutative group scheme, `C[M]` is the fibre product of `[M]`
   with the zero section, and closed immersions are stable under base
   change and closed under composition.

   Everything else in shapes 4 and 5 is now proven from it: the subgroup
   axioms and the cyclic-of-order-`M` condition in
   `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofTorsion` (the arithmetic input being
   `nsmul_eq_zero_iff_mem_zmultiples_div`: in `ℤ/N` with `M ∣ N` the
   `M`-torsion is the subgroup generated by `N / M`, of order exactly
   `M`), and base-change compatibility in `liesIn_ofDvd_iff` (from
   additivity and — for the converse direction — injectivity of
   `RelPoint.along`, which is where cartesianness of the square is used).

   Note the earlier statement of shape 4 described `C[M]` as the kernel
   of `[N / M]`.  That was a slip: in `ℤ/N` that kernel has order `N / M`,
   not `M`.  The object the degeneracy map needs is the unique subgroup
   of ORDER `M`, i.e. the kernel of `[M]`, generated by `N / M`.  The
   definition now says so.

*Amended a third time 2026-07-26: the compactification exists.*  Shape 3
no longer covers the two uniform statements either.  `Y_0(N)` is affine
and every route to `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` runs through the PROPER model, so
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime` and
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes` are now proven from
statements about `X_0(N)`, over the interface `IsCompactificationY0`:

7. `exists_compactificationY0` — the coarse space `Y_0(N)` is a smooth
   affine curve over `ℚ` and has a smooth proper compactification.  TRUE
   (Deligne–Rapoport III.1 / Katz–Mazur 8.2 for normality, plus the
   proper normal model of a function field).

8. `cuspidal_x0_prime` — Mazur 1978, Theorem 1: every rational point of
   `X_0(p)` is a cusp, for `p ∉ mazurIsogenyPrimes`.

9. `cuspidal_x0_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes` — Kenku's determination on the
   `61` residual semiprime levels, likewise on `X_0(pq)`.

Both 8 and 9 are quantified over EVERY model of the interface, so a
degenerate `X` cannot discharge them; and the passage from "cuspidal on
`X`" to "empty on `Y`" is no longer an informal remark but the proven
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_cuspidal`, resting on the equally proven
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_isEmpty` (one coarse space suffices, by
initiality).

The remaining missing subtree for 8 and 9 is `J_0(N)`: the Jacobian as an
abelian variety over `ℚ`, Abel–Jacobi from a rational cusp, and reduction
at a good prime.  With the interface in place the rank-`0` criterion can
now be STATED honestly — its conclusion is `∀ x : X(ℚ), hX.IsCusp x` and
the cusp count enters as a count of `X(𝔽_ℓ)` — which it could not be
while the module stopped at `Y_0(N)`.

The lemma they support, `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd`, is checked
against the ground truth by observing that the Mazur–Kenku list is
DIVISOR-CLOSED; see its docstring.

**Why the interface must pin `Y` down, and does.** A weaker interface —
say, a smooth projective curve over `ℚ` with a bijection on `ℚ̄`-points
— would be satisfied by `ℙ¹` for a cheap reason, and then
`Y0HasNoRationalPoint 20` would be FALSE rather than open, which is worse
than leaving the node untouched.  What rules that out is the *universal
property*: `IsCoarseModuliY0` asks for initiality among all `ℚ`-schemes
receiving a natural transformation from the moduli problem, and an
initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism.  So any `Y` satisfying
this interface is `ℚ`-isomorphic to the genuine `Y_0(N)`, and (3) is a
statement about the genuine `Y_0(N)`.

## What is NOT here, and is the next decomposition

The compactification layer (`IsX0Compactification`, `IsJacobianOf`,
`HasRankZeroJacobian`, `card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian`) is now written as
an INTERFACE, and the seven single-prime levels are proven over it.
What the interface's five leaves still need, and none of it exists at
this pin:

* the smooth compactification of a coarse moduli space, and the cusps
  of `X_0(N)` with their field of definition
  (`exists_x0Compactification`, `exists_rationalCusps`);
* `J_0(N)` as an actual abelian scheme, its Mordell–Weil group, and the
  reduction map with its formal-group kernel
  (`card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian`);
* `S_2(Γ_0(N))`, the Hecke algebra, `L`-functions of modular abelian
  varieties and Kolyvagin–Logachev, which supply the rank-`0` input
  (`hasRankZeroJacobian_of_kenkuLevel`), and Eichler–Shimura, which
  supplies the point counts (`exists_x0Compactification_mod_prime`).

Chabauty–Coleman is **not** on this list: the 2026-07-26 reconnaissance
found `rank J_0(N)(ℚ) = 0` at all eleven named levels, so none of them
needs it.  The four levels `45, 54, 63, 75` need a multi-prime
Mordell–Weil sieve instead, which is a strengthening of
`card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian` rather than a new theory.

/-! ### Relative points and a closed subscheme -/

/-- **A relative point lies in a subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`** when it factors
through `ι`.

For `ι` a closed immersion this is the functor-of-points description of
the closed subscheme `C ⊆ E`: it is a *subfunctor* of the functor of
points of `E` by construction (precomposition preserves factoring), so no
naturality axiom is needed for it anywhere below. -/
def RelPoint.LiesIn {E T C : Scheme.{u}} {f : E ⟶ T} (ι : C ⟶ E)
    {T' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T' ⟶ T} (x : RelPoint f g) : Prop :=
  ∃ y : T' ⟶ C, y ≫ ι = x.1

/-- **Transport of a relative point along a morphism lying over the
base.** If `map : E' ⟶ E` fits in a commuting square over `h : T' ⟶ T`
then a `T''`-point of `E'` over `g : T'' ⟶ T'` becomes a `T''`-point of
`E` over `g ≫ h`.

When the square is *cartesian* this map is the canonical identification
of the points of the base change with the points of `E` over the shifted
base point; it is used below only through cartesian squares, but nothing
in its definition needs that. -/
def RelPoint.along {E' T' E T : Scheme.{u}} {f' : E' ⟶ T'} {f : E ⟶ T}
    {h : T' ⟶ T} (map : E' ⟶ E) (hw : f' ≫ h = map ≫ f)
    {T'' : Scheme.{u}} {g : T'' ⟶ T'} (x : RelPoint f' g) :
    RelPoint f (g ≫ h) :=
  ⟨x.1 ≫ map, by rw [Category.assoc, ← hw, ← Category.assoc, x.2]⟩

/-! ### Cyclic subgroup schemes of order `N` -/

/-- **A cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N` of an abelian scheme.**

The data is a closed subscheme `ι : C ⟶ E`, **finite and flat** over the
base, whose relative points form a subgroup of the relative points of `E`
at every base point, and whose geometric fibres are cyclic of order
exactly `N`.

Four remarks on the axioms.

* Closedness and finiteness are what make this a subgroup *scheme*
  rather than a subfunctor; see the module docstring for why that
  distinction is load-bearing for faithfulness.
* **`flat` is not decoration; it is what makes this the Katz–Mazur
  moduli problem.**  Katz–Mazur **(6.7.1)** (p. 167) define a *cyclic
  group of order `N`* to be a "finite locally free commutative
  `S`-group-scheme, of rank `N`, and cyclic", and `IsFinite` together
  with `Flat` is exactly finite locally free (a finitely presented flat
  module is projective, and finite projective over a commutative ring is
  locally free).  Dropping flatness — as this structure did until
  2026-07-26 — makes the moduli problem STRICTLY LARGER than `[Γ₀(N)]`,
  so that the coarse-space existence theorem cited at
  `exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` does not apply to it.  The gap is real
  rather than notional, and here is the witness that was recorded when
  it was found:

  > Over `T = Spec ℚ[ε]` take `E = E₀ ×_ℚ ℚ[ε]` and a rational point `P`
  > of exact order `2` on `E₀`.  Then `C = Spec(ℚ[ε] × ℚ)` — the zero
  > section together with the *non-flat* thickening `ℚ[ε] ↠ ℚ` of the
  > `P`-component of `E[2]` — is closed in `E`, finite over `T`,
  > contains the zero section, and is closed under the group law
  > (`P + P = 0`), and its unique geometric fibre is `ℤ/2`.  Without
  > `flat` that is a `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` of order `2` which is not a
  > Katz–Mazur `[Γ₀(2)]`-structure.  With `flat` it is excluded, because
  > `ℚ[ε] × ℚ` is not a flat `ℚ[ε]`-module.

  Note that the witness is *non-reduced over the base*, which is why the
  omission was invisible at every base this development actually
  evaluates the moduli problem at — and why it had to be repaired in the
  interface rather than worked around at a leaf.
* The subgroup conditions are stated at *every* base point `g : T' ⟶ T`,
  which is the functor-of-points way of saying that the group law of `E`
  restricts to `C`; no naturality is required because `LiesIn` is a
  subfunctor automatically.
* `geom_cyclic` is the level-structure condition proper.  Over an
  algebraically closed field the relative points at a geometric point are
  the geometric points of that fibre, and the condition says they meet
  `C` in a cyclic group of order `N`.  In residue characteristic `0` —
  the only case used here — this is equivalent to `C` being finite étale
  with cyclic geometric fibres, so nothing is lost by phrasing it
  pointwise.

**Why `geom_cyclic` and not a `rank = N` field.**  Katz–Mazur pin the
*rank* of the finite locally free group scheme; this structure pins the
*cardinality of the geometric fibres*.  Over a base in which `N` is
invertible — in particular over any `ℚ`-scheme, which is the only case
the modular-curve layer evaluates — a finite flat group scheme is étale
(Cartier's theorem; Waterhouse, *Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*,
Thm. 11.4, or Tate, *Finite flat group schemes*, §3.7 in
Cornell–Silverman–Stevens), so its rank equals the number of points of
any geometric fibre and the two conditions agree.  Carrying the fibre
condition rather than the rank keeps the level structure statable
without `Scheme.Hom.finrank`, and is the form the descent leaf
`exists_cyclicSubgroupOfOrder_of_galoisStable` naturally produces. -/

/-! ### The `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem -/

/-- **A `Γ₀(N)`-structure over a scheme `T`**: an elliptic scheme over
`T` together with a cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N`.

"Elliptic scheme" is spelled out as *abelian scheme of relative dimension
one*: `AbelianSchemeStruct f` already carries properness, smoothness,
geometrically connected fibres, a zero section and a commutative group
law on the functor of points, and `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f` is what
makes the fibres curves rather than abelian varieties of arbitrary
dimension.

This is the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` of Katz–Mazur; its coarse space over
`ℚ` is `Y_0(N)`. -/
structure Gamma0Datum (N : ℕ) (T : Scheme.{u}) where
  /-- the total space of the elliptic scheme -/
  E : Scheme.{u}
  /-- the structure morphism of the elliptic scheme -/
  f : E ⟶ T
  /-- the abelian-scheme structure on `f` -/
  ab : AbelianSchemeStruct f
  /-- relative dimension one: the fibres are curves -/
  relativeDimensionOne : SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 f
  /-- the `Γ₀(N)`-level structure -/
  cyc : CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab N

/-- **`d'` is a base change of `d` along `h : T' ⟶ T`.**

Rather than construct pullbacks and transport structure along them, the
base-change relation is *stated*: a morphism `map` on total spaces making
a cartesian square, compatible with the group law and with the level
structure.  `RelPoint.along map isPullback.w` is the induced map on
relative points, and cartesianness is what makes it a bijection onto the
points over the shifted base point — a fact this development never needs
and therefore never proves.

Taking `h = 𝟙` recovers *isomorphism* of `Γ₀(N)`-data over a fixed base,
which is why a natural transformation out of the moduli problem (in the
sense of `IsCoarseModuliY0.classify_natural` below) is automatically
constant on isomorphism classes. -/

problem.**

The data is a classifying map sending a `Γ₀(N)`-structure over an
`S`-scheme `T` to a `T`-point of `Y`, natural in cartesian squares, which
is *initial* among all such.  This is Mumford's definition of a
categorical quotient / coarse moduli space, with the bijectivity on
geometric points — the second half of the usual definition — deliberately
omitted: initiality already determines `(Y, classify)` up to unique
isomorphism, which is all that faithfulness of the level statements
requires, and stating the geometric bijection would additionally require
a theory of isomorphisms of `Γ₀(N)`-data that nothing here consumes.

Over `S = Spec ℚ` the unique such `Y` is the modular curve `Y_0(N)`. -/

/-! ### The existence of `Y_0(N)`, and the bridge from Weierstrass curves -/

/-! ### The degenerate level `N = 0`

**The `Γ₀(0)`-moduli problem is supported on the empty scheme** — PROVEN
2026-07-26; this subsection was a single sorry leaf until then, and the
argument recorded here by its finder is the one that was carried out.

TRUE, and *elementary* — no modular-curve theory enters.  Suppose
`d : Gamma0Datum 0 T` and `T` had a point `x`.  Embedding the residue field
`κ(x)` into an algebraic closure `K` gives a geometric point
`t : Spec K ⟶ T`, and `d.cyc.geom_cyclic K t` then supplies a relative point
`y` with `addOrderOf y = 0` — that is, of *infinite* order — such that the
points of `d.cyc.C` above `t` are exactly `AddSubgroup.zmultiples y`.  But
`d.cyc.isFinite` makes `d.cyc.ι ≫ d.f` a finite morphism, so the fibre of
`d.cyc.C` over `t` is `Spec` of a finite-dimensional `K`-algebra and has only
finitely many `K`-points, whereas `AddSubgroup.zmultiples y ≃ ℤ` is infinite.
Contradiction, so `T` has no point at all.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE LEAF.  `[Γ₀(N)]` is a moduli problem only for
`N ≥ 1`, so `N = 0` is *outside* the Katz–Mazur theorem cited at
`exists_coarseModuliY0_of_pos` below.  Splitting it off is what makes that
citation honest: the cited theorem really does prove the `N ≥ 1` half, and
this degenerate half — the only part of `exists_coarseModuliY0` reachable at
this pin — is separated out rather than silently folded into the citation.

REACHABLE.  Formalising the argument needs exactly three things, all
present: stability of `IsFinite` under base change
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite` is an `IsStableUnderBaseChange` morphism
property), affineness of a scheme finite over a field, and the finiteness of
the set of `K`-algebra maps out of an Artinian `K`-algebra.

PROVEN 2026-07-26, along exactly those lines, from the two helper lemmas
`finite_sections_of_isFinite` and `infinite_zmultiples_of_addOrderOf_eq_zero`
below. -/

/-- **The sections of a finite morphism over a fixed geometric point are
finite in number.**

For `g : C ⟶ T` finite and `t : Spec K ⟶ T` a geometric point (`K`
algebraically closed), the `K`-points of `C` lying over `t` form a finite
set.

The proof is the classical one, and every step is mathlib API: `IsFinite`
is stable under base change, so `C ×_T Spec K` is finite over `Spec K`; a
quasi-finite quasi-compact scheme over an artinian one is artinian
(`IsLocallyArtinian.of_locallyQuasiFinite`), and an artinian scheme has a
finite underlying space (`IsArtinianScheme.finite`); and
`AlgebraicGeometry.pointEquivClosedPoint` identifies the sections of a
morphism of locally finite type to `Spec K` with the closed points of its
source.  A `K`-point of `C` over `t` induces such a section by the
universal property of the pullback, injectively. -/

`isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero` the `Γ₀(0)`-problem has no object over any
nonempty base, so the empty scheme `∅ ⟶ Spec ℚ` is a coarse moduli space

*initial*, so all three clauses of `IsCoarseModuliY0` are equalities of
morphisms out of an initial object.  This carries **no** arithmetic

## What is cited

Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic Moduli of Elliptic Curves*, Annals of Mathematics
Studies 108, Princeton, 1985:

* **Theorem 6.6.1** (p. 166): *the moduli problem `[Γ₀(N)]` is relatively
  representable over `(Ell)`; it is finite and flat over `(Ell)` of degree
  `(N²/φ(N))·∏_{p ∣ N}(1 − p⁻²)`, and is regular and two-dimensional.*
* **(8.1.1)** (p. 224), the construction of the coarse moduli scheme:
  *let `R` be a ring and `𝒫` a relatively representable moduli problem on
  `(Ell/R)` which is affine over `(Ell/R)`.*  Locally on `R` pick `n ≥ 3`
  invertible and a representable `𝒮` finite étale galois over `(Ell/R)`
  with group `G` — e.g. `𝒮 = [Γ(n)]`, `G = GL₂(ℤ/nℤ)` — and set
  `M(𝒫) = 𝔐(𝒫, 𝒮)/G`.  Katz–Mazur note that this "exists because
  `𝔐(𝒫, 𝒮)` is itself affine", and is independent of the choice of `𝒮`,
  so the local constructions patch.
* **(8.1.3)** (pp. 224–225): the canonical `G`-equivariant *classifying map*
  `S → M(𝒫)` attached to `E/S` with a level `𝒫`-structure, again
  independent of the auxiliary `n`.  This is `classify`, and its
  construction by descent along `S_n → S` is what makes it natural in `S`,
  i.e. `classify_natural`.
* **Lemma 8.1.3.1** (p. 225): for `k` algebraically closed, `M(𝒫)(k)` is
  the set of `k`-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with `𝒫`-structure.

The **initiality** clause is not part of Katz–Mazur's *definition* — they
define `M(𝒫)` by the quotient construction rather than by a universal
property — but it follows from it: `𝔐(𝒫, [Γ(n)])` is affine, so the
quotient of (8.1.1) is `Spec` of the ring of invariants, and that is a
categorical quotient in the category of all schemes (Katz–Mazur Chapter 7,
*Quotients by finite groups*, and its Appendix *Base change for rings of
invariants*; Mumford, *Geometric Invariant Theory*, Ch. 0 §2).  Initiality
of `(Y, classify)` in `IsCoarseModuliY0` is exactly that categorical-quotient
property transported along (8.1.3).

Deligne–Rapoport, *Les schémas de modules de courbes elliptiques*, in
*Modular Functions of One Variable II*, Lecture Notes in Math. 349 (1973),
143–316, is the companion reference and treats the same problem over
`ℤ[1/N]` (no theorem number is quoted here because it was not checked
against the text).

## Why the hypotheses match

* *Base ring.*  `R = ℚ`.  (8.1.1) needs some `n ≥ 3` invertible in `R` only
  locally; over a field of characteristic `0` every `n` is invertible, so
  the construction is global and no patching is needed.  `SpecQ` is
  `Spec ℚ`, so `Y ⟶ SpecQ` is exactly an `R`-scheme.
* *The moduli problem.*  `Gamma0Datum N T` is `[Γ₀(N)]` on `(Ell/ℚ)`:
  `ab` together with `relativeDimensionOne` is an elliptic curve `E/T`, and
  `cyc` is the cyclic subgroup of order `N`.  Theorem 6.6.1 supplies both
  hypotheses (8.1.1) asks for — relative representability, and finiteness
  over `(Ell)`, which gives affineness over `(Ell)`.
* *`N ≥ 1`.*  `[Γ₀(N)]` is defined only for `N ≥ 1`; the level `N = 0` is
  handled separately and degenerately by `exists_coarseModuliY0_zero`.

## FAITHFULNESS AUDIT: the one mismatch, and its REPAIR (2026-07-26)

Katz–Mazur **(6.7.1)** (p. 167) define a *cyclic group of order `N`* to be
a "finite locally free commutative `S`-group-scheme, of rank `N`, and
cyclic".

Until 2026-07-26 `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` asked only for a closed subgroup
scheme **finite** over the base with **geometric fibres** cyclic of order
`N` — it did **not** ask for flatness.  That made the moduli problem here
strictly *larger* than `[Γ₀(N)]`, so the theorem cited above did not
literally apply to it, and the gap was real rather than notional: over
`T = Spec ℚ[ε]` the non-flat thickening `C = Spec(ℚ[ε] × ℚ)` of a
`2`-torsion component satisfied every axiom and is not a KM
`[Γ₀(2)]`-structure.  The counterexample is written out in full in the
docstring of `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder`, where it now serves as the
justification for the axiom rather than as an open defect.

**The repair was made in the interface**, which is where it belonged: the
field `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.flat` requires `AlgebraicGeometry.Flat
(ι ≫ f)`, so the level structure is finite *and* flat over the base,
i.e. finite locally free.  A flatification retraction — the route a
successor would otherwise have had to supply — is no longer needed, and
the earlier plan to build one (`C ⊆ C^♭ ⊆ E[N]`, open and closed in the
`N`-torsion, formed compatibly with base change) is retired rather than
merely deferred.

**What remains, and why it is not a mismatch.**  KM pin the *rank*;
`geom_cyclic` pins the *number of points of each geometric fibre*.  Over
a `ℚ`-scheme — and every base at which `IsCoarseModuliY0 N (str : Y ⟶
SpecQ)` evaluates the problem is a `ℚ`-scheme, since a datum comes with
a structure map `g : T ⟶ SpecQ` — a finite flat group scheme is étale by
Cartier's theorem, so rank and geometric-fibre cardinality coincide, and
"cyclic" in KM's fppf-local sense coincides with cyclicity of the
geometric fibres.  So over `(Ell/ℚ)` the two moduli problems are the
same, and the citation applies to this one on the nose.

The step in that paragraph — Cartier's theorem — is a *statement about
the citation's hypotheses*, not a hidden lemma of the formalisation:
nothing below consumes it, and it is recorded so that a successor
closing this node knows precisely which classical fact reconciles the
two phrasings.

## Why it is IRREDUCIBLE at this pin

Surveyed 2026-07-26: `Mathlib` has no modular curve, no modular polynomial,
no moduli stack, no coarse-space existence theorem, no geometric invariant
theory and no quotient of a scheme by a finite group; `~/cs/FLT` takes the
weaker Mazur torsion bound as a bare `axiom`.  Every route to this
statement — Katz–Mazur (8.1.1) via `[Γ(n)]`-rigidification and quotients,
Deligne–Rapoport via stacks, or the classical construction of `Y_0(N)` as
the normalisation of `Φ_N(X, Y) = 0` in `𝔸¹ × 𝔸¹` with classifying map
`(E, C) ↦ (j(E), j(E/C))` — needs a theory that does not exist here. -/

/-! ### The two missing theories behind the bridge

`nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable` was originally left as a single sorry
node folding together two *independent* missing theories.  It is now
DERIVED (2026-07-26) from the two leaves of this subsection, which are
exactly those two theories, cut apart:

* `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass` — the geometry: the projective
  Weierstrass model of `E/ℚ` as an elliptic scheme over `Spec ℚ`;
* `exists_cyclicSubgroupOfOrder_of_galoisStable` — the arithmetic:
  Galois descent turning a Galois-stable finite subgroup of the geometric
  points into a closed subgroup scheme over `ℚ`.

The cut is at the *geometric fibre*: leaf (a) hands over an equivariant
additive identification of `E(ℚ̄)` with the geometric points of the
elliptic scheme, and leaf (b) consumes nothing about `E` at all — it is
stated for an arbitrary abelian scheme over `Spec ℚ`.  So neither leaf
mentions the other's subject matter, and the assembly below is pure
transport along that identification. -/

/-- **The projective Weierstrass model of `E/ℚ` as an elliptic scheme
over `Spec ℚ`** (sorry node — theory (a) of the bridge).

TRUE, and classical: a Weierstrass equation with invertible discriminant
over `ℚ` cuts out a smooth projective plane curve `A ⊆ ℙ²_ℚ` of relative
dimension `1` with a rational point at infinity, the chord–tangent law
makes its functor of points a commutative group functor, and properness,
smoothness and geometric connectedness of the fibre are the standard
facts about a smooth plane cubic.  The last conjunct says that the
resulting group of geometric points is `E(ℚ̄)` with its usual group law
and its usual Galois action — i.e. that the scheme really is *this*
curve and not merely some elliptic scheme.

**Why the equivariant identification is part of the statement, and not a
separate leaf.**  Without it the leaf would be satisfiable by any
elliptic curve over `ℚ` whatsoever, and the bridge below would then
manufacture a `Γ₀(N)`-datum out of the wrong curve — the level structure
transported from `E` would have nothing to attach to.  Pinning the
geometric fibre as a `Γ_ℚ`-module is exactly what rules that out, and it
is also precisely what the descent leaf needs as input, so the two fit
without an intermediate interface.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin: `Mathlib` has `WeierstrassCurve`,
`IsElliptic`, `WeierstrassCurve.Projective` and the group law on
`(E⁄K).Point` for a field `K`, but the elliptic curve as a *group
scheme* — the functor of points of the projective model, with the group
law as a natural transformation — does not exist anywhere in
`Mathlib`, and `~/cs/FLT` has no abelian schemes either (surveyed
2026-07-26).  This is the larger of the two theories. -/

**FALSITY AUDIT, 2026-07-26 — the hypothesis `hN : N ≠ 0` is NOT
decoration, and was ADDED on this date because the statement without it is
FALSE.**

At `N = 0` the conclusion is *unsatisfiable*, and the refutation is already
written down in this file: it is verbatim the argument of
`isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero` above.  `geom_cyclic` at `N = 0` demands a
relative point `y` with `addOrderOf y = 0` — of INFINITE order — such that
the points lying in `C` are exactly `AddSubgroup.zmultiples y ≃ ℤ`.  But
`isFinite` makes `ι ≫ f` finite, so `C` is `Spec` of a finite-dimensional
`ℚ`-algebra and `{x | RelPoint.LiesIn ι x}` injects into
`Hom(Spec K, C)` — a finite set, since `ι` is a closed immersion and hence
a monomorphism.  A finite set cannot be `zmultiples` of an infinite-order
element.  The base `Spec ℚ` is nonempty, so the geometric point needed to
run this is available (it is `specAlgClos ℚ ≫ 𝟙 SpecQ`, the very one the
hypotheses are stated at) and the argument is not vacuous.

Meanwhile the HYPOTHESES at `N = 0` are satisfiable: any elliptic curve
over `ℚ` of positive Mordell–Weil rank has a rational point `y` of infinite
order, `⟨y⟩` is fixed pointwise by `Γ_ℚ`, and `addOrderOf y = 0`.  So the
`N = 0` instance is a genuine false statement, not a vacuous one, and no
prover could ever have discharged it.

The defect propagated: `nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable` and
`false_of_stable_of_y0HasNoRationalPoint` below are PROVEN from this leaf
and were therefore false as stated too — the first would have produced a
`Gamma0Datum 0 SpecQ`, which `isEmpty_of_gamma0Datum_zero` forbids over the
nonempty base `Spec ℚ`.  Both now carry `hN` as well.  Nothing downstream
is weakened: all twelve level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` call
in at a concrete `N ≥ 20`, and the one infinite family at `N = p q` with
`p`, `q` prime.

TRUE for `N ≥ 1`, and this is the whole content of Galois descent for
finite étale schemes in characteristic `0`.  The argument: `⟨y⟩ ⊆ A(ℚ̄)` is a finite
`Γ_ℚ`-stable set, so its image in the topological space of `A` is a
finite set of closed points, stable under `Γ_ℚ`; give it the *reduced*
induced closed subscheme structure `C`.  Reduced and finite type over a
field of characteristic `0` is finite étale, `C(ℚ̄) = ⟨y⟩` because each
`Γ_ℚ`-orbit contributes one closed point whose residue field is the
field of definition of that orbit, and `C` is a subgroup scheme because
`C ×_ℚ C` is again reduced, so the two morphisms
`C ×_ℚ C ⇉ A` given by `ι ∘ pr₁ + ι ∘ pr₂` and its factorisation agree
once they agree on geometric points, `A` being separated.

Note the hypothesis is stated on the **generator only**: `galSMul σ` is
additive (it is the scalar action of `geomFibreAction`), so stability of
`y` up to `zmultiples` already gives stability of the whole subgroup.
That is the weakest honest form, and it is what the bridge below can
supply from the elementary hypothesis of the twelve level nodes.

`geom_cyclic` in the conclusion quantifies over *every* algebraically
closed `K` and every `K`-point of the base, not only over `ℚ̄`.  That is
not an extra assumption smuggled in: `ℚ` is initial among rings, so such
a base point is unique, and the algebraic closure of `ℚ` inside `K` is a
copy of `ℚ̄`, over which `C` is already split — so `C(K)` is again
`⟨y⟩`, with the same order `N`.

**PIN SURVEY, 2026-07-26 — do not repeat it, and note it is more
favourable than "nothing exists".**  What is PRESENT:

* `CommAlgCat.FiniteEtale R` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/Etale/Finite.lean`,
  new): the category of finite étale `R`-algebras, with the fiber
  functor `FiniteEtale.fiber R Ω : S ↦ (S →ₐ[R] Ω)`, base change, and
  `FiniteEtale.equivOfIsSepClosed` — but the equivalence is proven ONLY
  over a separably closed base, which is the split case and carries no
  descent.
* `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/`: Galois categories in the abstract,
  including `EssSurj` and `Prorepresentability`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.ext_of_isDominant_of_isSeparated`
  (`Morphisms/Separated.lean`): two morphisms out of a reduced scheme
  into a separated one agree as soon as they agree on a dominant
  subscheme.  This is exactly the rigidity step the subgroup axioms
  need, and it means `add_liesIn`/`neg_liesIn` at an ARBITRARY base
  `T'` should reduce to the geometric-point statement rather than
  needing a separate argument.
* `Scheme.IdealSheafData.subscheme` / `subschemeι`
  (`AlgebraicGeometry/IdealSheaf/Subscheme.lean`): closed subschemes cut
  out by an ideal sheaf, with the closed-immersion API.

What is ABSENT, and is the actual content of this leaf:

* no `PreGaloisCategory` instance anywhere except `Action FintypeCat G`,
  so `FiniteEtale k` is NOT known to be a Galois category and the
  correspondence with finite continuous `Γ_k`-sets — the descent
  direction, over a NON-closed base — does not exist;
* no construction of the reduced induced closed subscheme structure on a
  closed subset of a scheme (`grep` over `AlgebraicGeometry/` finds no
  `reducedSubscheme` of any spelling).

So the honest cut for a successor is: build the reduced induced
structure, or go through `CommAlgCat.FiniteEtale` on affines and glue.
The algebra-side scaffolding is fresher than the module docstring's
"no modular curves anywhere" survey would suggest.

**NOTE ON THE `flat` FIELD** (added to `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder`
2026-07-26, when the level structure was corrected to Katz–Mazur's
"finite locally free").  This leaf now owes a proof of
`AlgebraicGeometry.Flat (ι ≫ f)` as well, and that costs it **nothing**:
the base here is `SpecQ = Spec ℚ`, a field, over which every module is
flat.  So the extra field is discharged by flatness of `C` as a
`ℚ`-scheme, whichever construction of `C` a successor chooses, and no
part of the descent argument above has to change.  The strengthening of
the interface is paid for entirely by the *general-base* consumers, not
here. -/

This is the bridge between the elementary phrasing used in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` — a Weierstrass curve over `ℚ` and a point
of order `N` over `ℚ̄` generating a Galois-stable subgroup — and the
moduli problem.  All of its mathematical content now sits in
`exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass` (the elliptic curve as a group
scheme) and `exists_cyclicSubgroupOfOrder_of_galoisStable` (Galois
descent for the level structure); what is left here, and proven, is the

`hstable` is verbatim the stability hypothesis carried by the twelve

/-- **The consumption rule of this module.**

If `Y_0(N)` has no rational point but some elliptic curve over `ℚ` has a
Galois-stable cyclic subgroup of order `N`, then the classifying map
produces a rational point of `Y_0(N)` — a contradiction.  This is the one
place where the three sorried inputs above meet, and it is what the
twelve level nodes of `FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` call.

`hN : N ≠ 0` was ADDED 2026-07-26, as the last link of the propagation
described in the FALSITY AUDIT of
`exists_cyclicSubgroupOfOrder_of_galoisStable`: at `N = 0` this statement
too is FALSE, since a rational point of infinite order on a positive-rank
curve satisfies `hg` and `hstable` while `Y0HasNoRationalPoint 0` holds
vacuously (the coarse space of the degenerate level is the empty scheme).
It is supplied at every call site by `norm_num`, all twelve level nodes

/-! ### Functoriality in the level, and the descent along divisors

The twelve level nodes below are twelve *separate* determinations of the
rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and nothing about that is
uniform.  What IS uniform, and is built here, is the degeneracy map

`Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` for `M ∣ N`, `(E, C) ↦ (E, C[M])`,

together with its consequence `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd`.  That single
lemma is what turns the one *infinite* family among the twelve —
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_prod_two_primes`, quantified over all pairs of
distinct primes — into a finite list of levels, by letting Mazur's prime
theorem be applied to a prime divisor of the level rather than to the
level itself.  It is stated here, once, rather than reproved inside each
level node.

**Why it is stated over the coarse space and not over data.**  A rational
point of `Y_0(N)` need not come from a `Γ₀(N)`-datum over `ℚ` — that is
exactly what "coarse" costs — so the map on points cannot be defined
pointwise.  It is obtained instead from the *universal property* of
`Y_0(N)`: `d ↦ classify_M (d.ofDvd)` is a natural transformation from the
`Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem to `Y_0(M)`, and initiality produces the morphism
`u : Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)` over `ℚ` through which every rational point is
pushed.  This is the only place in the module where `universal` is used,
and it is why that field was stated. -/

/-! #### The cyclic group theory behind `C[M]`

Three elementary facts about a cyclic group of order `N`, isolated here
so that `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofTorsion` below is pure bookkeeping.  In
`ℤ/N` with `M ∣ N` the unique subgroup of order `M` is generated by
`N / M` and is exactly the `M`-torsion; that is the content of the second
lemma, and it is what makes `C[M]` a `Γ₀(M)`-structure. -/

/-- **The `M`-torsion of a cyclic subgroup scheme is again cut out by a
closed subscheme, finite over the base** (sorry node).

TRUE: `C` is finite flat over `T` with cyclic geometric fibres, hence a
finite flat commutative group scheme, so multiplication by `M` is an
endomorphism of `C` over `T` and `C[M]` is the fibre product of
`[M] : C ⟶ C` with the zero section `T ⟶ C`.  The zero section of a
scheme finite — hence separated — over `T` is a closed immersion, closed
immersions are stable under base change, and closed immersions compose;
so `C[M] ⟶ C ⟶ E` is a closed immersion and `C[M] ⟶ T` is finite.  On
relative points, membership of `C[M]` is membership of `C` together with
`M • x = 0`, which is what the characterisation below records.

This holds for EVERY `M`, with no divisibility hypothesis and no
constraint relating `M` to `N`: for `M = 0` the condition `0 • x = 0` is
vacuous and `C` itself works, and in general `C[M] = C[gcd (M, N)]`.
Keeping the leaf free of hypotheses it does not need is deliberate — the
arithmetic that `M ∣ N` buys is entirely group-theoretic and is
discharged in `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofTorsion` below, so this node
carries only the geometry.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason as
`nonempty_gamma0Datum_of_stable`: the functor-of-points presentation used
here carries the group law on `RelPoint` rather than as a morphism
`E ×_T E ⟶ E`, so `[M] : C ⟶ C` is not available as a morphism of
schemes and the fibre product cannot be formed.  Supplying it needs the
group law as a morphism, which is the same missing theory.

**FLATNESS IS PART OF THIS LEAF** (added at integration, 2026-07-26, and
it is not decoration).  `CyclicSubgroupOfOrder` acquired a `flat` field —
that field is what makes the structure Katz–Mazur's finite *locally free*
`[Γ₀(N)]` rather than a strictly larger moduli problem; see the field's
own docstring for the `Spec ℚ[ε]` counterexample.  This leaf and
`CyclicSubgroupOfOrder.ofDvd` were written independently, against the
structure BEFORE and AFTER that field existed, so they merged cleanly and
then could not build: `ofTorsion` had no flatness to put in the field.
Carrying it here is the right place — `C[M]` is a torsion subscheme of an
already-flat `C`, so whatever construction discharges this leaf produces
flatness along with finiteness, and no separate argument is needed.  It
is threaded through `ofTorsion`'s `hflat` argument to `ofDvd`. -/

/-- **A torsion subscheme of a cyclic subgroup scheme of order `N` is a
cyclic subgroup scheme of order `M`, for `M ∣ N`** (PROVEN).

This is everything about `C[M]` that is not the representability handled
by `exists_torsionSubscheme`: the subgroup axioms, which follow from
`smul_zero` / `smul_add` / `smul_neg` because `M • (-)` is additive, and
the level condition `geom_cyclic`, which is
`nsmul_eq_zero_iff_mem_zmultiples_div` applied fibre by fibre with
generator `(N / M) • y`.

`hN` excludes `N = 0`.  It is not cosmetic: `N = 0` asks the geometric
fibres of a scheme FINITE over the base to be infinite cyclic, so
`CyclicSubgroupOfOrder ab 0` is in fact vacuous — but vacuous for a
reason (finiteness of `ι ≫ f`) that this development does not have the
machinery to exploit, and without `hN` the statement would read as the
false claim that an infinite cyclic group has a subgroup of order `M`. -/

`M ∣ N` then `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`** (PROVEN).

This is the uniform half of every composite level statement.  The proof
is the universal property and nothing else: `d ↦ classify_M (d.ofDvd)` is
a natural transformation from the `Γ₀(N)`-moduli problem to a coarse
space of the `Γ₀(M)`-problem, so initiality of `Y_0(N)` yields a
`ℚ`-morphism `u : Y_0(N) ⟶ Y_0(M)`, and composing a rational point of
`Y_0(N)` with `u` gives one of `Y_0(M)`.

**Sanity check against the ground truth.**  The contrapositive says the
set of levels with a rational point is closed under divisors, and the
Mazur–Kenku list `{1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163}` is indeed
divisor-closed: `27 ↦ 9, 3`; `25 ↦ 5`; `21 ↦ 3, 7`; `18 ↦ 9, 6, 3, 2`;
`16 ↦ 8, 4, 2`; `12 ↦ 6, 4, 3, 2`, and every proper divisor of a level
`≤ 19` is `≤ 19`.  The four large primes `37, 43, 67, 163` have no proper
divisor but `1`.  So this lemma is consistent with the classification,
which is the check that matters — a level statement that contradicted it
would be false rather than open. -/

/-! ### One coarse space suffices, and the smooth compactification

`Y0HasNoRationalPoint N` quantifies over EVERY coarse moduli space of the
`Γ₀(N)`-problem, which is the right statement but the wrong thing to work
with: a level computation is carried out on one model.  The first lemma
below closes that gap once and for all — emptiness at a single coarse
space propagates to all of them, by the same initiality argument as
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd` with `M = N`.

The rest of this section is the **compactification interface**, which the
module docstring names as the next decomposition and which is built here.
Its purpose is to move the two remaining uniform statements — Mazur's
prime theorem and Kenku's semiprime range — off the affine `Y_0(N)` and
onto `X_0(N)`, which is where their proofs live and where the only known
routes (rank `0` plus reduction, and Chabauty–Coleman) can even be
phrased.  See the docstring of `y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes`
for why they CANNOT be phrased against `Y_0(N)` alone. -/

/-- **Emptiness at one coarse space propagates to all of them** (PROVEN).

Any two coarse spaces of the `Γ₀(N)`-problem are canonically
`ℚ`-isomorphic by initiality, so it is enough to exhibit ONE with no
rational point.  The proof does not even need the isomorphism: initiality
of `str'` against the natural transformation `classify` of `str` gives a
`ℚ`-morphism `u : Y' ⟶ Y` along which a rational point of `Y'` pushes to
one of `Y`.

This is what lets every level computation below be performed on a single
chosen model. -/

/-- **`str_X : X ⟶ Spec ℚ` is the smooth compactification of the coarse
space `str_Y : Y ⟶ Spec ℚ`.**

`Y_0(N)` is a smooth affine curve over `ℚ`; `X_0(N)` is the unique smooth
proper curve containing it as a dense open subscheme, and the finite
complement is the set of cusps.  The interface records exactly that: an
open immersion `j` over `ℚ` with dense image into a proper smooth `X`.

**Why these four conditions and no fewer.**  A smooth curve has a smooth
compactification that is unique up to unique isomorphism *given the
curve*, so `IsOpenImmersion j`, `IsDominant j`, `IsProper strX` and
`Smooth strX` together pin `X` down as tightly as `IsCoarseModuliY0` pins
`Y` — and `Y` is already pinned by initiality.  Dropping density would
allow `X = Y ⊔ (anything proper)`; dropping properness would allow
`X = Y` with no cusps at all.  Neither would make any statement below
FALSE — the leaves are quantified over all models of the interface, so a
degenerate model only makes them harder — but both would make the
interface useless to the layer it exists to enable, since `J_0(N)` and
reduction at a good prime are statements about the proper model.

**Why there is no cusp DATA here.**  Cuspidality is a property, not a
choice: a rational point of `X` is a cusp exactly when it does not come
from a rational point of `Y` (`IsCompactificationY0.IsCusp`).  For an
open immersion that is the honest scheme-theoretic condition, and
carrying a `Finset` of cusps instead would be an invitation to state a
count as a hypothesis — which is precisely the smuggling that
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes`'s docstring warns
against. -/

For an open immersion this is the scheme-theoretic condition: a

through `Y`, so the points that do not factor are exactly the ones
supported on the closed complement.

The condition `y ≫ strY = 𝟙` is not imposed and is not missing: it

This is the bridge the module was missing, and it is the step that the
sentence "`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists only of cusps is literally `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`"
in the module docstring was asserting informally.  It is now a proof: a
rational point of `Y` maps to a rational point of `X` that visibly comes
from `Y`, hence is not a cusp; so if every rational point of `X` is a
cusp then `Y` has none, and `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_isEmpty` carries
that from this one model to every coarse space. -/

/-- **Existence of the smooth compactification `X_0(N)`** (sorry node).

TRUE, and classical, in two independent halves:

* the coarse space `Y_0(N)` is a smooth affine curve over `ℚ` — normality
  of a coarse moduli space of a smooth DM stack of dimension one, plus
  "normal curve = smooth curve" (Deligne–Rapoport III.1, Katz–Mazur 8.2);
* a smooth curve over a field has a smooth compactification, unique up to
  unique isomorphism — the standard function-field construction, the
  proper normal model of the function field of `Y`.

For `N = 0` the moduli problem is supported on the empty base (a scheme
finite over its base cannot have infinite cyclic geometric fibres), so
`Y_0(0)` is the empty scheme and `X = Y = ∅` satisfies every condition
vacuously; the statement is therefore uniform in `N`.

IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin: neither the normality of coarse spaces
nor the smooth compactification of a curve exists here, and both are
genuinely separate theories from anything else in this module. -/

TRUE — Mazur, *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math. 44
(1978), Theorem 1: `X_0(p)(ℚ)` consists of the two cusps `0` and `∞` for
every prime `p ∉ {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43, 67, 163}`.

**This is the statement in the shape Mazur proves it**, which is the
point of routing `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime` through it.  The argument
is: the Eisenstein quotient `J̃` of `J_0(p)` has Mordell–Weil rank `0`
(Mazur, *Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal*, Publ. Math. IHÉS 47
(1977)); `x ↦ [x − ∞]` embeds `X_0(p)(ℚ)` in `J̃(ℚ)`, which is therefore
finite; and a specialisation argument at `3` forces the image to be
cuspidal for `p ≥ 23`, `p ∉ {37, 43, 67, 163}`.  Every object in that
sentence — `J_0(p)`, the Hecke algebra, the Eisenstein ideal, the
Mordell–Weil theorem, reduction of an abelian variety — is a subtree that
does not exist at this pin, and none of it can be *stated* against the
affine `Y_0(p)`.

Quantified over every model of `IsCompactificationY0`, so it is at least
as strong as the `Y_0(p)` statement it replaces and cannot be discharged
by a degenerate choice of `X`.

Note the conclusion is genuinely stronger than the elliptic-curve
statement `WeierstrassCurve.prime_mem_cyclicIsogenyDegrees` in

TRUE — this is Mazur, *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math.
44 (1978), Theorem 1, in its modular-curve form: `X_0(p)(ℚ)` consists of
the two cusps for every prime `p ∉ {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43,

**This is the statement that makes the semiprime family finite**, via
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd` applied to `p ∣ p * q`; it is the only
uniform input available, since every other tool here is a per-level
computation.

Relation to what is already in the tree.  The elliptic-curve phrasing,
`WeierstrassCurve.prime_mem_cyclicIsogenyDegrees`, is PROVEN in
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` from the single leaf
`WeierstrassCurve.not_isogenyCharacter_of_prime_ge_twentyThree`.  That
module *imports* this one, so the implication cannot be used in this
direction, and in any case the modular-curve statement is genuinely
STRONGER: it rules out rational points of the coarse moduli space, which
need not be represented by a pair `(E, C)` defined over `ℚ`.  The two
should be reconciled once the layer below exists — the honest route is to
prove this node and *derive* the elliptic-curve one from it through
`false_of_stable_of_y0HasNoRationalPoint`, which is exactly the shape
`MazurTorsion.lean` already uses for the twelve composite levels.

a cusp, for every prime `p ≥ 11`.

TRUE, and it is Kenku's theorem.  The Mazur–Kenku list of levels `N` with
`Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` is

    1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163,

whose largest element is `163`; and for a prime `p ≥ 11` the level `p²` is
at least `121`, is a perfect square, and is therefore in the list only if
it is one of `1, 4, 9, 16` — all of which are `< 121`.  So `p² ` is outside
the list for EVERY prime `p ≥ 11`, uniformly, with no case analysis.

**Why `11 ≤ p` and not merely `p` prime.**  The bound is sharp at both
ends of the small range: `4`, `9` and `25` are all IN the Mazur–Kenku
list, so the statement is FALSE at `p = 2, 3, 5`.  (`p = 7` gives `49`,
which is outside the list, so the statement happens to be true there too —
but `49` is the separate concern of `MazurLevelFortyNine` and is left to

half of the level-`p` ⟷ level-`p²` dictionary.
`FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` already carries that dictionary in ONE
direction: `not_cyclicIsogeny_sq_of_jInvariant` builds two distinct
Galois-stable lines of order `p` on a Vélu quotient out of a cyclic
`p²`-subgroup, and so is proven FROM the level-`p` leaf
`not_two_stable_lines_of_jInvariant`.  Feeding that implication back would
be circular.  Routing the CONVERSE through this node instead is not: the
statement below is about the modular curve, is independent of both
elliptic-curve leaves, and is exactly the shape in which Kenku proves it.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin, for the same reason as every other level node
here: `X_0(p²)` has genus `≥ 6` for `p ≥ 11` (already `X_0(121)` has genus
`6`), so this is a determination of the rational points of a curve of high
genus, and neither `J_0(N)`, nor its Mordell–Weil group, nor
Chabauty–Coleman exists in this development.  Sources: Kenku, *The modular

**WHAT THIS NODE STILL NEEDS, and why it is a subtree rather than a
leaf.**  Every one of the `61` pairs has `X_0(pq)` of genus `≥ 2` —
already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`, and no semiprime level has genus `1`
(the genus-`1` levels are `11, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 32, 36,
49`, of which only `14, 15, 21` are semiprimes and all three are
excluded).  So none of them is an elliptic-curve rank computation, and
each is settled by one of:

* **rank `0` plus reduction** — `J_0(pq)(ℚ)` finite, Abel–Jacobi
  `X_0(pq) ↪ J_0(pq)` at a rational cusp, injectivity of reduction at a
  good prime `ℓ`, and then `#X_0(pq)(ℚ) ≤ #X_0(pq)(𝔽_ℓ) = #cusps`;
* **Chabauty–Coleman** for the pairs where the rank is positive but
  below the genus.

Neither is stated as a leaf here, deliberately.  Both are statements
about `X_0(pq)` — the SMOOTH COMPACTIFICATION, its cusps, its Jacobian,
and an integral model to reduce along — and this module stops at the
affine coarse space `Y_0(N)` precisely to keep that out of the critical
path.  Writing either criterion against `Y_0(N)` alone would have to
smuggle the point count into a hypothesis, since rank `0` by itself gives
FINITENESS of `X_0(N)(ℚ)` and never emptiness of `Y_0(N)(ℚ)`; the step
from finite to empty *is* the cusp count.  A criterion whose hypothesis
is equivalent to its conclusion would be a false economy, so the honest
next decomposition is the compactification interface first
(`X_0(N) ⊇ Y_0(N)` proper smooth, with its rational cusps), then
`J_0(N)` as an abelian scheme, and only then the two criteria.

**The first of those three steps is DONE (2026-07-26).**
`IsCompactificationY0` above is the compactification interface, and this
node is now proven from `cuspidal_x0_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes`, which is
the same assertion about `X_0(pq)`.  What remains for a later owner is
step two — `J_0(N)` as an abelian variety over `ℚ`, with Abel–Jacobi from
a rational cusp and reduction at a good prime — and only then step three,
the rank-`0` criterion.  Note that with the interface in place the
rank-`0` criterion CAN now be stated honestly: its conclusion is
`∀ x : X(ℚ), hX.IsCusp x`, and the cusp count enters as a count of
`X(𝔽_ℓ)`, not as a hypothesis about `X(ℚ)`. -/

/-! ### The compactification `X_0(N)`, its cusps, and `J_0(N)`

`Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` cannot be proved on the affine curve alone.  The
classical route bounds the rational points of the **compactification**:
`rank J_0(N)(ℚ) = 0` makes `J_0(N)(ℚ)` finite, hence `X_0(N)(ℚ)` injects
into `X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` for a good odd prime `ℓ`; and `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅` follows
only when that count is already exhausted by points known to be rational
— the **cusps**, which live in `X_0(N) ∖ Y_0(N)`.  So the step from
*finite* to *empty* IS the cusp count, and any criterion phrased over
`Y_0(N)` alone would have to assume it as a hypothesis equivalent to its
own conclusion.

This subsection therefore builds, in the order that observation forces:

1. `IsX0Compactification` — `Y_0(N) ⊆ X_0(N)` as an open subscheme of a
   smooth proper curve with finite complement;
2. `IsJacobianOf` and `HasRankZeroJacobian` — `J_0(N)` by its Albanese
   universal property, and the two arithmetic inputs;
3. `card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian` — the reduction bound;
4. `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_witnessPrime` — the assembly, PROVEN, and
   what the seven single-prime levels below call.

The arithmetic that feeds it is the Magma reconnaissance recorded in the
`#### Reconnaissance` block below. -/

  ⟨y.1 ≫ j, by rw [Category.assoc, hj, y.2]⟩

/-- **The number of `ℚ`-rational cusps of `X_0(N)`.**

The cusps of `X_0(N)` are indexed by pairs `(d, a)` with `d ∣ N` and
`a ∈ (ℤ/gcd(d, N/d))ˣ`, and `Γ_ℚ` permutes the `φ(gcd(d, N/d))` cusps
above a given `d` transitively, through the cyclotomic character of
`ℚ(ζ_{gcd(d, N/d)})`.  So the cusps above `d` are rational exactly when
`φ(gcd(d, N/d)) = 1`, and this is the number of such divisors.

The TOTAL number of cusps is `∑_{d ∣ N} φ(gcd(d, N/d))`, which is
strictly larger at two of the seven levels below — `12` against `6` at
`N = 36`, and `12` against `4` at `N = 50`.  Counting against the total
rather than against the rational count would make the level statements
unprovable there, and is the trap this definition exists to avoid.

Values consumed below, each by `decide`:
`20 ↦ 6`, `24 ↦ 8`, `28 ↦ 6`, `30 ↦ 8`, `36 ↦ 6`, `42 ↦ 8`, `50 ↦ 4`. -/

/-- **`strX : X ⟶ S` is the smooth compactification of the coarse moduli
space `strY : Y ⟶ S`, with `j : Y ⟶ X` the open immersion.**

`X` is proper and smooth of relative dimension `1` over `S`,
geometrically connected, and contains `Y` as an open subscheme with
FINITE complement — that complement is the cusp locus.

This pins `X` as the genuine `X_0(N)`: `Y` is pinned up to unique
isomorphism by the initiality clause carried in the `coarse` field, a
nonempty open of a connected curve is dense, and a smooth proper curve
containing a given smooth curve as a dense open is its unique smooth
compactification.  Dropping `finite_compl` would break exactly that —
`X` could then be any curve receiving `Y`, with the cusp count
meaningless.

The base `S` is general on purpose: the same structure over `Spec 𝔽_ℓ`
with `ℓ ∤ N` is the good reduction `X_0(N)_{𝔽_ℓ}`, and
`card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian` relates the two. -/

/-- **`ab` is the Jacobian of the curve `strX`, based at `o`.**

Stated by the Albanese universal property, in the same
functor-of-points style as `IsCoarseModuliY0`: the Abel–Jacobi map
`x ↦ [x] − [o]` is a natural transformation from the points of `X` to
the points of an abelian scheme sending `o` to `0`, and it is INITIAL
among all such.  For a smooth proper geometrically connected curve the
Albanese variety with a base point is exactly the Jacobian, so this
determines `(J, aj)` up to unique isomorphism — which is what makes
`HasRankZeroJacobian` a statement about `J_0(N)` rather than about some
arbitrary abelian scheme that happens to receive `X(ℚ)`.

Note what is deliberately NOT a field here: injectivity of `aj` on
points.  It holds exactly when the genus is positive — for genus `0` the
Jacobian is trivial — so it is an independent condition, and it is
carried explicitly by `HasRankZeroJacobian` instead. -/

/-- **`rank J_0(N)(ℚ) = 0`, together with `genus X_0(N) ≥ 1`.**

The two arithmetic inputs of the reduction argument, packaged as one
existential over the Jacobian because both are statements about it:

* `J(ℚ)` is FINITE — for an abelian variety over a number field the
  Mordell–Weil group is finitely generated, so finiteness is exactly
  rank `0`;
* the Abel–Jacobi map is INJECTIVE on rational points, which is
  positivity of the genus.

The second is not decoration.  Without it the reduction criterion below
is FALSE: at `N = 1` the curve `X_0(1) = ℙ¹` has trivial Jacobian, hence
finite `J(ℚ)`, and infinitely many rational points.

Both hold at all eleven Kenku levels — see

formal group over `ℤ_ℓ`, which is torsion-free for `ℓ` odd; Abel–Jacobi
based at a rational point embeds `X_0(N)(ℚ)` into `J_0(N)(ℚ)` and
commutes with reduction; so `X_0(N)(ℚ)` injects into `X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)`.

**Every hypothesis is load-bearing**, and the leaf is false without any
one of them — which is why none is trimmed:

* without finiteness in `hJ`, a positive-rank Jacobian gives infinitely
  many rational points already in genus `1`;
* without injectivity in `hJ`, `N = 1` refutes it: `X_0(1) = ℙ¹` has
  trivial Jacobian and infinitely many rational points;
* without `hℓ2` the formal-group argument fails at `ℓ = 2`, where
  `2`-torsion can die under reduction;
* without `hℓN` there is no good reduction at `ℓ` and the special fibre
  is not a smooth curve.

The conclusion bounds every `Finset` of rational points rather than
`Nat.card`, because `Nat.card` of an infinite type is `0` and the bound
would then hold vacuously; the `Finset` form also carries finiteness.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin: it needs the integral model of `X_0(N)`, the
reduction map on the Jacobian, and the formal group of an abelian
scheme. -/

/-- **The single-prime criterion** (PROVEN): at a level whose Jacobian
has rank `0`, and which has a witness prime whose point count equals the
number of rational cusps, `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.

The argument is pure counting, and it is the reason the interface above
is shaped as it is.  Take the compactification `Y ⊆ X` over `ℚ` and the
reduction `X'` over `𝔽_ℓ`.  The `c = numRationalCusps N` rational cusps
are `c` distinct rational points of `X`, none of them the image of a
rational point of `Y`.  A rational point of `Y` would therefore push
forward to a `(c+1)`-st one, giving a `Finset` of `X(ℚ)` of size
`c + 1`; but the reduction bound caps every such `Finset` by
`#X'(𝔽_ℓ) = c`.  So `Y(ℚ)` is empty — and
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_isEmpty` propagates that to every coarse moduli
space at once.

This is exactly the step that cannot be taken on the affine curve: rank
`0` bounds `#X_0(N)(ℚ)`, and only the cusp count turns that bound into
emptiness of `Y_0(N)(ℚ)`. -/

/-! ### The twelve levels of Kenku's non-prime-power determination

Each statement below is the level `N` of the Mazur–Kenku classification,
restated as a claim about the rational points of the modular curve
`Y_0(N)`.  The levels `N` for which `Y_0(N)(ℚ) ≠ ∅` are exactly

`1, …, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, 43, 67, 163`

(Mazur, *Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal*, Publ. Math. IHÉS 47
(1977); *Rational isogenies of prime degree*, Invent. Math. 44 (1978);
Kenku's series, Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 85 (1979) and 87
(1980), J. London Math. Soc. (2) 22 (1980) and 23 (1981), J. Number
Theory 15 (1982)), and none of the levels below is in that list.

All of them are IRREDUCIBLE at this mathlib pin for the same reason: each
is a determination of the rational points of a curve of genus `≥ 1`, and
neither `J_0(N)`, nor its Mordell–Weil group, nor Chabauty–Coleman exists
in this development.  See the module docstring for the three subtrees
that are needed. -/

/-- **`Y_0(pq)(ℚ) = ∅` for `pq` a product of two distinct primes outside
`{6, 10, 14, 15, 21}`** (sorry node — the uniform, squarefree part of
Kenku's determination).

Those five products are exactly the semiprimes in the Mazur–Kenku list.
The statement is uniform but its content is finite: by Mazur's prime
node both `p` and `q` lie in `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 37, 43, 67,
163}`, so `61` of the `66` unordered pairs need excluding — among them
`X_0(35)` and `X_0(39)` (Kenku 1979), `X_0(65)` and `X_0(91)` (Kenku
1980).  Already `X_0(22)` has genus `2`.

PROVEN 2026-07-26, as exactly that reduction from an infinite family to a
finite one.  The case split is on whether the two prime divisors of the
level lie in `mazurIsogenyPrimes`:

* if `p` does not, then `Y_0(p)(ℚ) = ∅` by `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prime`,
  and `p ∣ p * q` carries it up to the level by
  `y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_dvd` — this is where the infinitude goes;
* symmetrically for `q`;
* if both do, the level is one of the `61` residual products and the
  content is `y0HasNoRationalPoint_semiprime_of_mazurPrimes`.

So the mathematics is relocated onto two nodes — Mazur's prime theorem
and Kenku's finite check — and the quantifier over all pairs of distinct
primes is discharged here by the degeneracy map `Y_0(pq) ⟶ Y_0(p)`. -/

/-! #### Reconnaissance for the eleven named levels (2026-07-26)

The arithmetic data deciding the route for each of the eleven levels
below was computed with Magma and is recorded here so that no later
owner has to recompute it.  Two facts hold **uniformly** across all
eleven, and together they fix the shape of every proof:

* **`rank J_0(N)(ℚ) = 0` for all eleven.**  Decomposing the cuspidal
  subspace of `S_2(Γ_0(N))` into newform factors and evaluating
  `L(A, 1)` on each, *every* factor at *every* one of the eleven levels
  has `L(A, 1) ≠ 0`; so `J_0(N)` has analytic rank `0`, and hence
  Mordell–Weil rank `0` by Kolyvagin–Logachev.  **No level below needs
  Chabauty–Coleman.**  (This corrects the guess recorded in the `N = 28`
  docstring before this pass, which called it "a Jacobian/Chabauty
  computation".)
* Consequently `J_0(N)(ℚ)` is finite, reduction `J_0(N)(ℚ) → J_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)`
  is injective for every odd prime `ℓ ∤ N` of good reduction, and — using
  a rational cusp as base point for Abel–Jacobi — `X_0(N)(ℚ)` injects
  into `X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)`.  So `#X_0(N)(ℚ) ≤ #X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)`.

The counts come from Eichler–Shimura,
`#X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ) = ℓ + 1 − Tr(T_ℓ ∣ S_2(Γ_0(N)))`.  Writing `c(N)` for the
number of **`ℚ`-rational** cusps — the divisors `d ∣ N` with
`φ(gcd(d, N/d)) = 1` — the table is:

| `N` | genus | cusps | `c(N)` | best `ℓ` | `#X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` | route |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|----------|------------------|-------|
| 20  | 1 | 6  | 6 | 3  | 6 | closes |
| 24  | 1 | 8  | 8 | 5  | 8 | closes |
| 28  | 2 | 6  | 6 | 5  | 6 | closes |
| 30  | 3 | 8  | 8 | 17 | 8 | closes |
| 36  | 1 | 12 | 6 | 5  | 6 | closes |
| 42  | 5 | 8  | 8 | 11 | 8 | closes |
| 45  | 3 | 8  | 4 | 7  | 8 | sieve |
| 50  | 2 | 12 | 4 | 3  | 4 | closes |
| 54  | 4 | 12 | 4 | 5  | 6 | sieve |
| 63  | 5 | 8  | 4 | 5  | 8 | sieve |
| 75  | 5 | 12 | 4 | 7  | 8 | sieve |

**Seven levels — `20, 24, 28, 30, 36, 42, 50` — close on a single
prime**: at the `ℓ` listed, `#X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ) = c(N)`, and the `c(N)`
rational cusps already realise that many rational points, so
`X_0(N)(ℚ)` consists exactly of the rational cusps and `Y_0(N)(ℚ) = ∅`.

**Four levels — `45, 54, 63, 75` — do not.**  For these the single-prime
bound is strictly weaker than `c(N)`: no prime `ℓ < 100` with `ℓ ∤ N`
attains `#X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ) = c(N)`, the minima over `3 ≤ ℓ < 60` being `8`
at `ℓ = 7` (`N = 45`), `6` at `ℓ = 5` (`N = 54`), `8` at `ℓ = 5`
(`N = 63`) and `8` at `ℓ = 7` (`N = 75`), against `c(N) = 4` in each
case.  They need a **multi-prime Mordell–Weil sieve**: the image of
`X_0(N)(ℚ)` in the finite group `J_0(N)(ℚ)` must be simultaneously
compatible with `X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ) → J_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` for several `ℓ` at once.
The `gcd` of `#J_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` over `3 ≤ ℓ < 60`, which bounds
`#J_0(N)(ℚ)`, is `512`, `243`, `6144` and `2560` respectively — so the
sieve has a genuinely finite search space, but one prime is not enough.

**The interface that was missing here now exists** (2026-07-26), in the
subsection above: `IsX0Compactification` (`X_0(N)` with its cusp locus),
`IsJacobianOf` / `HasRankZeroJacobian` (`J_0(N)` and the rank-`0`
input), and `card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian` (reduction mod `ℓ`).  The
seven single-prime levels are PROVEN over it by
`y0HasNoRationalPoint_of_witnessPrime`, and what remains open is that
subsection's five leaves — none of them level-specific.

**The four sieve levels `45, 54, 63, 75` are still open**, and what they
need is a multi-prime strengthening of `card_le_of_rankZeroJacobian`:
the bound must intersect the images of `X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ) → J_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` over
several `ℓ` at once, rather than reduce at a single one.  That is a
strengthening of one leaf, not a new theory, and it reuses every other
piece unchanged. -/

`rank J_0(45)(ℚ) = 0` (both newform factors have `L(A, 1) ≠ 0`), so
`X_0(45)(ℚ)` is finite and injects into `X_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ)` for every odd
`ℓ ∤ 45`.  But `X_0(45)` has `8` cusps of which only `4` are rational,
and **no** prime `ℓ < 100` attains `#X_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ) = 4`: the minimum over
`3 ≤ ℓ < 60` is `8`, at `ℓ = 7`.  So a single reduction leaves a factor
of `2` unaccounted for, and the four rational points must be pinned by
intersecting the images of `X_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ) → J_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ)` over several
`ℓ` simultaneously.  `#J_0(45)(ℚ)` divides `512`.

owner, *independently* of the pass that produced the table above; every
entry of that table for all eleven levels — genus, cusps, `c(N)`, best
`ℓ`, `#X_0(N)(𝔽_ℓ)` — was reproduced exactly, so the reconnaissance is
confirmed rather than merely inherited).  `#X_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ)` over
`3 ≤ ℓ < 60`: `7 ↦ 8`, `11 ↦ 16`, `13 ↦ 20`, `17 ↦ 16`, `19 ↦ 8`,

`47 ↦ 40`, `53 ↦ 64`, `59 ↦ 64`.  So `ℓ = 19` is a *second* witness for
the minimum `8`, which the table above does not record.  The Jacobian
orders `#J_0(45)(𝔽_ℓ) = det(ℓ + 1 − T_ℓ ∣ S_2(Γ_0(45)))` are `512, 2048,
4096, 5120, 4096, 13824, 28672, 32768, 110592, 53248, 64000, 89600,
180224, 229376` at those same `ℓ`; their `gcd` is `512`, attained already

**WHY THIS LEAF IS NOT HARDER THAN ITS SEVEN SINGLE-PRIME SIBLINGS
*HERE*** (2026-07-26; this note is shared by all four sieve levels and is
written out only at this one).  The split "seven close on one prime, four
need a sieve" is a fact about the CLASSICAL arguments.  It is **not** a
difficulty ordering for this development, and reading it as one produces
phantom work.  All eleven levels are blocked on exactly the same absent
object — `X_0(N)` as a scheme, its cusps, `J_0(N)`, Mordell–Weil, and
reduction mod `ℓ` — none of which exists in `Mathlib` or in `~/cs/FLT`
(re-surveyed 2026-07-26: `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/` contains no abelian
variety and no modular curve of any kind).  Once that layer exists, a
sieve level costs one extra *finite* computation over a single-prime
level, and the arithmetic for it is fully recorded above.  Until it
exists, neither kind can be advanced by any amount of effort spent at
the level nodes themselves.  The shared layer is owned by the sibling
node `y0HasNoRationalPoint_prod_two_primes`; that is where work on these
eleven has to go first. -/

NOT attained at the best counting prime — `#J(𝔽_7) = 11·2560` — so at
