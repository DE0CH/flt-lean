# The projective Weierstrass model as an elliptic scheme over `Spec ℚ`

This module assembles `Fermat.exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`
(`Fermat/FLT/ModularCurve/X0.lean`) out of the pieces that had to land
first, and it exists as a SEPARATE module for one specific reason, given
under "Why this is not in `X0.lean`" below.

## Main definitions and results

* `Fermat.ProjGroupLaw` — morphism-level group-law data on the projective
  Weierstrass model, in exactly the shape
  `AbelianSchemeStruct.ofMorphisms` consumes.
* `Fermat.ProjGroupLaw.toAbelianSchemeStruct` — the bridge to
  `AbelianSchemeStruct` (PROVEN, formal).
* `Fermat.exists_ellipticScheme_of_projModel` — the assembled statement,
  which `X0.lean` transports verbatim onto
  `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`.

`isProper_projToSpec` and `nonempty_projGroupLaw` are both PROVEN, and so now is
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec` apart from ONE named leaf.  Its `hchart`
step is fully reduced, the Jacobian criterion it rests on (`jacobianSpan_eq_top`,
over an arbitrary commutative ring) is proven here, and
`locally_isStandardSmooth_awayCoord` — the last direct sorry of item 7a — is now
PROVEN, out of three declarations in the "Dehomogenisation" section.  One of
them, `isStandardSmoothOfRelativeDimension_projChartAway` (a plane curve is
standard smooth of relative dimension `1` where a partial derivative is
invertible), is PROVEN, and so is `projChart_jacobian_span_eq_top` (the chart
Jacobian criterion, where `hjac` and hence `Δ` is consumed — proven UNIFORMLY in
the chart index by passing to a residue field, so none of the three-chart case
analysis its plan predicted was needed).  Only `exists_projChartRingEquiv` is
still open there: the dehomogenisation isomorphism
`(ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))_{(xᵢ)}` in degree `0` ≃ `ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ)`, a missing piece of
MATHLIB rather than of this development.

The open leaves are therefore `exists_projAdd` — where all the remaining gluing
work for the group law now lives — `exists_projChartRingEquiv`,
`exists_projGeomFibreAddEquiv`, and the interior of
`geometricallyConnected_projToSpec`, which still carries three named sorried
steps `hbc`/`hne`/`hpre`.  Each declaration carries its own docstring saying what
is missing and where the classical argument is.

`nonempty_projGroupLaw` is PROVEN: two of the three data fields of a
`ProjGroupLaw` are constructed outright in `ProjectiveModel.lean`
(`projNeg`, the Weierstrass involution through `Proj.map`; `projInfty`,
the point at infinity through `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections`), and all three
"lies over the base" fields are free over this base
(`hom_ext_spec_rat`).  What remains is `exists_projAdd`: the group law
`m` itself, together with the four group axioms.

## Why this is not in `X0.lean`

**A global token collision, and it is not a stylistic choice.**
`ProjectiveModel` reaches
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Projective/Basic.lean` and through
it `Mathlib/Tactic/Ring/NamePolyVars.lean`, which declares the command
syntax `name_poly_vars … " over " …`.  **Lean's token table is global**: an
atom reserved by any transitively imported module becomes a keyword,
whether or not the notation is ever opened.  So the bare identifier `over`
stops parsing in every module that transitively imports `ProjectiveModel`.

That is not hypothetical.  `X0.lean` declares
`IsCompactificationY0.over`, and `X0.lean` is `public import`ed by
`MazurTorsion.lean`, whose own dependent cone includes `ModThree.lean`,
`HermiteMinkowski.lean`, `Mazur.lean`, `InertiaCardTransport.lean` and
`CompletionInvariance.lean` — and `ModThree.lean` uses mathlib's
`Ideal.LiesOver.over`.  A `public import` of `ProjectiveModel` into
`X0.lean` therefore breaks files several modules downstream, with the error
reported at their `over` occurrence rather than at the import.

Keeping the `ProjectiveModel` dependency HERE, and having `X0.lean` take a
NON-public `import` of this module, confines the reserved token to
`X0.lean` itself (where the single affected field is written `«over»`,
which preserves the declaration name exactly) instead of propagating it
through the whole `MazurTorsion` cone.

The statement of `exists_ellipticScheme_of_projModel` is existential over
the scheme, so it mentions neither `proj` nor `projToSpec`; that is what
makes a proof-body-only use in `X0.lean`, and hence the non-public import,
sufficient.

/-- **Any two morphisms of schemes to `Spec ℚ` are equal** (PROVEN).

`Hom_Sch(X, Spec R) ≃ Hom_Ring(R, Γ(X, ⊤))` (the `Γ ⊣ Spec` adjunction,
here through `AlgebraicGeometry.ext_to_Spec`), and `ℚ →+* A` is a
subsingleton (`Rat.subsingleton_ringHom`: `ℤ → ℚ` is a ring epimorphism, so
a ring map out of `ℚ` is forced — `n ↦ n · 1` and `1/n ↦ (n · 1)⁻¹`).

**Consequence for this file, and it removes three obligations.**  Every
"lies over the base" field of `ProjGroupLaw` — `hm`, `he`, `hi` — is an
equation between two morphisms whose TARGET is `Spec ℚ`, so all three hold
automatically and carry no geometric content whatsoever.  Over a general
base they are real conditions; over `Spec ℚ` they are not, because a
scheme admits at most one morphism to `Spec ℚ` and hence every morphism
between `ℚ`-schemes is automatically a `ℚ`-morphism.  This is what lets
`nonempty_projGroupLaw` below be reduced to the group axioms alone.

`X0.lean` records the same fact downstream as `subsingleton_hom_specQ`;
the two are deliberately differently named, because `X0.lean` imports this
module and a shared name would be a duplicate declaration there.  They
should be merged at integration, keeping this one (it is upstream). -/

/-  `MvPolynomial.gradedAlgebra` is deliberately not a global instance in mathlib (a
different weight function gives a different grading), so — exactly as in
`ProjectiveModel.lean`, and by the same convention mathlib uses for
`homogeneousSubmodule` — it has to be reintroduced locally in any file that mentions
`projGrading` as a graded ring rather than merely mentioning `proj`/`projToSpec`,
whose *types* carry no instance. -/

/-- **Morphism-level group-law data on the projective Weierstrass model
of `E`**, in exactly the shape `AbelianSchemeStruct.ofMorphisms`
consumes: a group law on the fibre square, a unit section over the base,
an inversion, each compatible with the structure morphism, and the four
group axioms as EQUATIONS OF MORPHISMS.

This is why the node is writable at all.  `AbelianSchemeStruct.add` is an
operation on `RelPoint f g` for an ARBITRARY test scheme `T`, and there
is no functor-of-points description of `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` at this pin —
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` gives only
functoriality `Proj ℬ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` in the graded ring.  So `add` cannot be
written by hand on `T`-points.  Equations of morphisms can be, and
`ofMorphisms` derives the `T`-point presentation from them.

This structure carries no ellipticity hypothesis: it is data plus
equations, and it is satisfiable only for a genuine elliptic curve, which
is recorded in `nonempty_projGroupLaw` where the hypothesis belongs.  It
is deliberately NOT an interface to build against — `AbelianSchemeStruct`
is that interface, and `toAbelianSchemeStruct` is the one-line bridge. -/

(sorry node — what is left of items 5+6 once the inversion `i`, the unit
section `e` and the three structure-morphism compatibilities have been
discharged; see `nonempty_projGroupLaw` for the assembly).

TRUE and classical.  The addition FORMULAS are already at this pin over
an arbitrary `[CommRing R]` —
`WeierstrassCurve.Projective.addXYZ`/`addX`/`addY`/`addZ` in
`EllipticCurve/Projective/Formula.lean` — so nothing has to be invented;
what is missing is the *gluing*.  The formulas degenerate on the locus
where the naive chart fails, so `m` is obtained from the standard
three-chart cover of `A ×_ℚ A` together with agreement on the overlaps.
`hassoc` (item 6) is the one axiom that is not a chart computation: as an
equation of morphisms out of `A ×_ℚ A ×_ℚ A` it is classically the
rigidity lemma, or the theorem of the cube, or — since `A ×_ℚ A ×_ℚ A` is
reduced and its generic fibre dense, `ℚ` having characteristic zero — a
reduction to equality of the two composites on `ℚ̄`-points, where it is
associativity of the classical group law of `E(ℚ̄)`.  That last route is
the cheapest here, and it is why ellipticity rather than mere smoothness
is hypothesised: `Δ ≠ 0` is what makes the generic fibre a smooth curve
and the reducedness argument valid.

`hcomm`, `hunit` and `hinv` are chart identities in the same formulas,
and are the easy half.

## What this leaf does NOT have to do any more, and why

Five obligations were removed from the original single leaf, and the
statement below is the residue.  **This is a strengthening, not a
weakening**: `hunit` and `hinv` are now demanded against the specific,
named `projInfty E` and `projNeg E` rather than against an existentially
quantified `e` and `i`, so a witness for this leaf is strictly harder to
produce than a witness for the old one, and the old statement follows from
it (see `nonempty_projGroupLaw`).

* `i` is now **constructed**, as
  `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.projNeg E` — the substitution
  `Y ↦ −Y − a₁X − a₃Z` is a degree-preserving ring automorphism of
  `ℚ[X, Y, Z]` fixing the Weierstrass polynomial on the nose, so it
  descends to a graded automorphism of the homogeneous coordinate ring and
  `Proj` is a functor of that (`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.map`).  No gluing,
  no charts.  It is an involution: `projNeg_comp_projNeg`.
* `e` is now **constructed**, as
  `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.projInfty E` — the point at infinity
  `[0 : 1 : 0]`, obtained from `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections`, whose
  hypothesis is exactly that the chosen coordinates have no common zero.
  Again no gluing.
* `hm`, `he`, `hi` are **free over this base** (`hom_ext_spec_rat`): each
  is an equation between morphisms whose target is `Spec ℚ`, and a scheme
  has at most one morphism to `Spec ℚ`.

## ROUTE AUDIT (2026-07-27), stating the checks that would refute it

The `m`-half is gated on scheme-theoretic infrastructure that is genuinely
absent, and the axis searched was *how to write a morphism into a `Proj`*:

1. There is no functor-of-points description of `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` at this
   pin — `ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` gives only functoriality
   `Proj ℬ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` in the graded ring, which is exactly the route that
   *did* work for `projNeg` and does **not** work for `m` (the group law
   is not induced by a graded ring map, since its source is a product).
   *Refuting check*: grep `ProjectiveSpectrum/` for a `Proj`-valued
   universal property, or for `Scheme.OpenCover.glueMorphisms` applied to
   a `Proj` target.
2. So `m` has to be glued out of an open cover of `A ×_ℚ A`, and each
   piece is an affine morphism written from the `addXYZ` formulas.
   *Refuting check*: find a chart on which the naive formula is defined
   everywhere — there is none, which is precisely why `addXYZ` has
   branches.
3. `hassoc` additionally needs the density statement "two morphisms out
   of a reduced finite-type `ℚ`-scheme into `proj E` agreeing on
   `ℚ̄`-points are equal".  *Refuting check*: grep mathlib for a scheme
   morphism ext lemma over closed points of a Jacobson base.

The axis NOT searched: a rigidity/theorem-of-the-cube route that would
derive `hassoc` from `hcomm`, `hunit`, `hinv` and properness without
touching points.  That would be a genuinely different cut and it is where
the next owner should start if the gluing proves too expensive. -/

The three data fields are supplied as follows.  `m` comes from
`exists_projAdd`, which is where all the remaining gluing work lives.

`projNeg E`, `Proj` of the graded automorphism `Y ↦ −Y − a₁X − a₃Z` of

/-- **The projective Weierstrass model is proper over `Spec ℚ`** (PROVEN).

`projToSpec` is `Proj.toSpecZero` FOLLOWED by
`Spec.map (algebraMap ℚ (projGrading E 0))`, and properness is not stable under
postcomposition in general, so the proof is in two halves.

*The first factor.*  Mathlib has `IsProper (Proj.toSpecZero 𝒜)` under
`[Algebra.FiniteType (𝒜 0) A]`.  That hypothesis is obtained here by descending
`Algebra.FiniteType ℚ (ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))` — itself a quotient of a polynomial ring
in finitely many variables — along the tower `ℚ → projGrading E 0 → ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W)`
with `Algebra.FiniteType.of_restrictScalars_finiteType`.

*The second factor* is an ISOMORPHISM: the degree-zero part of the homogeneous
coordinate ring of the Weierstrass cubic is `ℚ` itself.  Surjectivity is
`MvPolynomial.homogeneousSubmodule_zero` (`homogeneousSubmodule σ R 0 = 1`), which
says every degree-`0` homogeneous polynomial is a constant.  Injectivity is the
observation that the ideal `(W)` meets the constants trivially, and the cheap proof
of that is NOT a degree count but the ring hom `MvPolynomial.constantCoeff`: it kills
`W` (a homogeneous polynomial of degree `3 ≠ 0` has no constant term), so it kills
every multiple of `W`, while it sends `C c` to `c`.

Two implementation notes worth keeping, both of which cost a verification cycle:

* The `IsScalarTower ℚ ↥(projGrading E 0) (ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))` that
  `of_restrictScalars_finiteType` consumes must be produced with `R`/`S`/`A` PINNED BY
  NAME.  Elaborating the statement instead picks the `Submodule.smul` and
  `Submodule.Quotient.instSMul'` scalar actions, whereas every `FiniteType` lemma is
  stated over `Algebra.toSMul`; the two are a diamond, and `apply` fails to unify.
* Both bridging identities — `↑(algebraMap ℚ ↥(𝒜 0) c) = algebraMap ℚ A c` and
  `algebraMap ↥(𝒜 0) A x = ↑x` — are `rfl`
  (`SetLike.GradeZero.coe_algebraMap`, `SetLike.GradeZero.algebraMap_apply`), which is
  what makes the two `Subtype.val` crossings free.

**FORMAL-CONTENT NOTE.** `[E.IsElliptic]` is NOT used: properness holds for the
projective model of an arbitrary Weierstrass equation over `ℚ`, singular or not, since
`Proj` of a finite-type graded ring is always proper over its degree-zero part.  The
discriminant enters only at `smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec`.  The hypothesis is
retained because the signature is consumed by `ProjGroupLaw.toAbelianSchemeStruct` and
is fixed by the cut, not because this leaf needs it. -/

/-! ### The Jacobian criterion for a Weierstrass equation

The three lemmas below are the ring-theoretic heart of item 7a, and they hold over an
ARBITRARY commutative ring — nothing here is special to `ℚ`.

The point is `Δ_mem_jacobianSpan`: the discriminant lies in the ideal generated by the
Weierstrass polynomial and its two partial derivatives, evaluated at any pair of ring
elements.  Granted that, `IsElliptic` (which says `Δ` is a UNIT) upgrades "the Jacobian
ideal contains `Δ`" to "the Jacobian ideal is everything" at any point OF the curve, which
is exactly the hypothesis the Jacobian criterion for smoothness consumes.

The certificate is found by a route that keeps the cofactors small.  Written directly, the
identity `Δ = A·W + B·W_X + C·W_Y` in `ℚ[a₁,…,a₆][X, Y]` has cofactors of forty-odd terms
(confirmed by a Gröbner `lift`).  But mathlib's own variable change `(X, Y) ↦ (X + x, Y + y)`
— i.e. `VariableChange.mk 1 x 0 y` — carries the curve to one whose `a₃`, `a₄`, `a₆` ARE
(up to sign) the three quantities `W_Y`, `W_X`, `W` evaluated at `(x, y)`, while fixing `Δ`.
So it suffices to certify `Δ ∈ (a₃, a₄, a₆)` in `ℤ[a₁,…,a₆]`, where the cofactors are tiny
and `ring` closes the identity outright.  That is `Δ_eq_coeffCombination`.

A numerical check worth recording: over `ℚ[a₁,…,a₆][u, v]` the Jacobian ideal of each of the
three standard charts does NOT contain `1`, so `Δ` is genuinely carrying the content here —
the statement is not vacuously true. -/

/-- **`Δ` lies in the ideal `(a₃, a₄, a₆)`**, with explicit cofactors.

/-! ### Dehomogenisation: the standard affine chart of `Proj` of a polynomial quotient

This is the MISSING MATHLIB PIECE of item 7a, and nothing below is elliptic-curve
mathematics: it is the identification of the degree-zero part of an away-localisation of a
graded polynomial quotient with a concrete polynomial quotient.  Mathlib has
`HomogeneousLocalization.Away` and `Proj.awayι` but no such identification — a grep for
`dehomogeni` over the pin returns NOTHING, and neither `~/cs/FLT` nor this project has one.

The three declarations below cut the residual leaf into three independent pieces, each
stated exactly as `locally_isStandardSmooth_awayCoord` consumes it and each carrying its own
proof plan.  The assembly is written and PROVEN. -/

not of this development).

  `(ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))_{(Xᵢ)}` in degree `0`  ≃  `ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ)`,

compatibly with the two structure maps out of `ℚ`.  It is stated as a `RingEquiv` together
with the commuting triangle rather than as an `AlgEquiv` deliberately: the source carries an
`Algebra (projGrading E 0)` instance and the target an `Algebra ℚ` one, and forcing them
into a common `Algebra ℚ` structure invites exactly the "two defeq but never syntactically
equal instances" trap this development has been bitten by repeatedly.  The commuting
triangle is what the consumer actually needs, and it is instance-free.

## Proof plan

*Surjectivity is already in mathlib.*  `HomogeneousLocalization.Away.adjoin_mk_prod_pow_eq_top`
says that if the graded ring is generated over its degree-zero part by homogeneous `vₗ` of
degrees `dvₗ`, then `𝒜_(f)` for `f` of degree `d` is generated as a `𝒜₀`-algebra by the
elements `(∏ vₗ^aₗ) / f^a` with `∑ aₗ dvₗ = a d` and `aₗ ≤ d`.  Here `d = 1` (that is what
`hcoord` supplies), the `vₗ` are the three coordinates `x₀, x₁, x₂` of degree `1`, so the
constraint `aₗ ≤ 1` forces each generator to be a product of a SUBSET of the coordinates
divided by `xᵢ^{card}` — i.e. a product of the three ratios `xⱼ / xᵢ`, one of which is `1`.
So the chart ring is generated over `ℚ` by the two ratios, which is exactly surjectivity of
the map `ℚ[u, v] → (B_{xᵢ})₀` sending `u, v` to the two ratios.

*The kernel is the one genuinely new argument.*  Let `q ∈ ℚ[u, v]` of degree `n` and let
`Q := Xᵢ^n · q(Xⱼ/Xᵢ, Xₖ/Xᵢ)` be its homogenisation, so the image of `q` is `Q̄ / xᵢ^n`.
That vanishes iff `Xᵢ^m · Q ∈ (W)` in `ℚ[X, Y, Z]` for some `m`.  Now `ℚ[X, Y, Z]` is a UFD,
`Xᵢ` is prime, and `Xᵢ ∤ W` for each of the three `i` — `W` contains the monomial `-X³` (so
`Y ∤ W` and `Z ∤ W`) and the monomial `Y²Z` (so `X ∤ W`).  Hence no prime factor of `W` is
associate to `Xᵢ`, and `W ∣ Xᵢ^m Q` forces `W ∣ Q`.  Dehomogenising, `wᵢ ∣ q`.  The reverse
inclusion is immediate since `W` maps to `0`.

Note this argument does NOT need `W` irreducible, only `Xᵢ ∤ W`, which is a monomial check.
The relevant mathlib entry points are `UniqueFactorizationMonoid` and
`MvPolynomial.prime_X` / `MvPolynomial.isDomain`.

This is the piece that ought to be upstreamed: stated for an arbitrary homogeneous ideal of
`R[X₀ .. Xₙ]` it is the standard affine chart of `Proj` of a projective scheme over `R`, and
its absence is what has kept every `Proj`-level smoothness argument out of reach. -/

/-- **THE GEOMETRIC CORE — over a FIELD there is no singular point.**

`hjac` (the affine Jacobian criterion, where `Δ` is consumed) forbids a point of the
projective Weierstrass curve at which all three homogeneous partials vanish and some
coordinate equals `1`.  The proof is a two-case check on whether the point is at infinity,
and **neither case mentions a chart** — that is what makes
`projChart_jacobian_span_eq_top` uniform in `i`.

* `P z ≠ 0`: the point is affine, `hjac` applies at `S := k`, and the two affine partials
  are `eval P W_X / P z ^ 2` and `eval P W_Y / P z ^ 2`, both zero — so `span {0, 0} = ⊤`
  in a field, absurd.
* `P z = 0`: the projective equation degenerates to `P x ^ 3 = 0`, so `P x = 0`, and then
  `eval P W_Z = P y ^ 2`, forcing `P y = 0`.  Every coordinate vanishes, contradicting
  `P i = 1`.  (The constant term of `W_Z` is what does the work here; this is the point at

/-- **THE CHART JACOBIAN CRITERION** (PROVEN): on each of the three charts the two partial
derivatives of the dehomogenised Weierstrass cubic generate the UNIT ideal of the chart
ring.  This is what makes the chart ring locally a hypersurface with an invertible partial,
and it is where `hjac` — hence `Δ` — is consumed.

## NOT VACUOUS, and true on all three charts

Checked with a Gröbner basis over `ℚ(a₁, …, a₆)`: for each of the three charts the ideal
generated by `wᵢ` and its two partials is `(1)`.  So the statement holds for all `i`, not
merely for the affine chart, and `Δ` is genuinely doing the work (over `ℚ[a₁, …, a₆]` the
ideal is proper — that is the content of `Δ_mem_jacobianSpan`).

## The proof, and why it is UNIFORM in `i`

The plan recorded with this leaf while it was open had three cases: `hjac` applied directly
on the affine chart `i = 2`; a unit `Z/X` on the chart `i = 0`; and, for the chart `i = 1`
containing the point at infinity, a coprimality step `span {p₂, z} = ⊤` combined with
`IsCoprime.pow_right` over the localisation away from `z`.  A Gröbner cofactor certificate
was offered as the fallback for that last chart.

**None of that is needed, and there is no case split on `i` below.**  The move that removes
it is to apply `hjac` not over the chart ring itself but over a RESIDUE FIELD of it.
Suppose the span were proper.  Pull it back: the ideal
`J := (wᵢ, ∂wᵢ/∂u, ∂wᵢ/∂v)` of `ℚ[u, v]` is then proper too, since its image in
`ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ)` is exactly the span in question.  So `J ⊆ M` for some maximal `M`, and
`k := ℚ[u, v] ⧸ M` is a FIELD.  Let `P : Fin 3 → k` be the image of the chart point, so
`P i = 1` and `P j = ūⱼ` for `j ≠ i`.  Then

* `eval P W = 0`, because `W` dehomogenises to `wᵢ ∈ J ⊆ M` (`eval_map_eq_dehomogenizeAt`);
* `eval P W_{Xⱼ} = 0` for `j ≠ i`, because dehomogenisation commutes with those partials
  (`pderiv_dehomogenizeAt`) and `∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ ∈ J ⊆ M`;
* `eval P W_{Xᵢ} = 0` as well, by Euler's relation together with `P i = 1`
  (`eval_pderiv_projPolynomial_eq_zero`).

So `P` is a singular point of the projective Weierstrass curve over a FIELD, which
`false_of_eval_pderiv_projPolynomial_eq_zero` rules out in two chart-free cases.

The point at infinity is not a special case here: it is the `P z = 0` case there, and what
disposes of it is the constant term of `W_Z` — precisely the fact the original plan had
identified as operative for the chart `i = 1`.  Passing to a residue field is what lets that
one observation serve all three charts at once, and it is why no localisation, no
`IsCoprime.pow_right`, and no Gröbner cofactor certificate appear in the proof. -/

/-- **A PLANE CURVE IS STANDARD SMOOTH OF RELATIVE DIMENSION `1` WHERE A PARTIAL DERIVATIVE
IS INVERTIBLE** (PROVEN; it was LEAF C of the residual item-7a leaf, and it is a piece of
MATHLIB rather than of this development).

## The construction

`Algebra.PreSubmersivePresentation.naive` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/Extension/Presentation/
Submersive.lean`) builds a pre-submersive presentation of `R[Xₛ] ⧸ (vᵣ)` from an INJECTIVE
assignment `a : relations → variables`, with `jacobiMatrix_naive` computing the Jacobian
matrix as `(vⱼ).pderiv (a i)`.  So the whole of the construction is:

* variables `σ := ProjChartVar i ⊕ Unit`, i.e. `(u, v, t)` — three of them;
* relations `ι := Fin 2`, namely `wᵢ` and `t · ∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ - 1`;
* the assignment `a` sends the first relation to `uⱼ` and the second to `t`, which is
  injective;
* the Jacobian matrix is then LOWER TRIANGULAR,
  `[[∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ, 0], [t · ∂²wᵢ/∂uⱼ², ∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ]]`, with determinant `(∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ)²`, a unit in the
  quotient because the second relation says `t` inverts it;
* `dimension = card σ - card ι = 3 - 2 = 1`, using
  `Fintype.card (ProjChartVar i) = 2`.

The one piece of plumbing is the identification of the presented ring with `T`:

  `ℚ[u, v, t] ⧸ (wᵢ, t·∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ - 1)`  ≃  `(ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ))_{∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ}`,

obtained from `MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft` (or `sumAlgEquiv`) to split off `t`, then
`Ideal.polynomialQuotientEquivQuotientPolynomial` to push the quotient by `wᵢ` inside, then
`Localization.awayEquivAdjoin` — which is precisely
`Localization.Away r ≃ₐ[R] AdjoinRoot (C r * X - 1)` — to recognise the remaining quotient.
The one piece of plumbing is the identification of the presented ring with `T`,

  `ℚ[u, v, t] ⧸ (wᵢ, t·∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ - 1)`  ≃  `(ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ))_{∂wᵢ/∂uⱼ}`.

It is built here by hand as a pair of mutually inverse maps rather than by chaining
mathlib's quotient/localisation equivalences: `Ideal.Quotient.liftₐ` in one direction and
`IsLocalization.lift` in the other, compared on generators with `MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext`
and `IsLocalization.ringHom_ext`.  That turned out to be markedly shorter than assembling
`MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft`, `Ideal.polynomialQuotientEquivQuotientPolynomial` and
`Localization.awayEquivAdjoin`, and it avoids the `Algebra ℚ (MvPolynomial V ℚ ⧸ I)` SMul
diamond — `Submodule.Quotient.instSMul'` versus `Algebra.toSMul` — which defeats
`IsScalarTower.of_algebraMap_eq` on the nose and is why the maps below are compared as
RING homs wherever the chart ring is involved.

Then `SubmersivePresentation.ofAlgEquiv` transports the presentation onto `T`, and the
dimension count is `Nat.card (Option (ProjChartVar i)) - Nat.card (Fin 2) = 3 - 2 = 1`.

/-- **THE RESIDUAL LEAF OF ITEM 7a** — the degree-zero part of the localisation of the
homogeneous coordinate ring at a coordinate is locally standard smooth of relative
dimension `1` over `ℚ`.

Everything else in `smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec` is now proven: the reduction to
the three coordinate charts, the identification of each chart composite with a `Spec.map`
(`awayι_projToSpec_eq_specMap`), the passage to the ring-hom property
(`smoothOfRelativeDimension_specMap_of_locally`), and the Jacobian criterion itself
(`jacobianSpan_eq_top`, supplied here as `hjac` and therefore genuinely consumed).

## THIS IS NOW PROVEN, from three named sub-leaves

The recipe below is written out and compiles; what remain are the three declarations in the
"Dehomogenisation" section above, each of which is a missing piece of MATHLIB rather than
any further elliptic-curve mathematics:

* `exists_projChartRingEquiv` (LEAF A) — the **dehomogenisation isomorphism**
  `(ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))_{(xᵢ)}` in degree `0` ≃ `ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ)`, with the commuting triangle
  over `ℚ`.  Mathlib has `HomogeneousLocalization.Away` and `Proj.awayι` but NO
  identification of the degree-zero away-part with a concrete polynomial quotient — a grep
  for `dehomogeni` over the pin returns nothing, and neither does one over `~/cs/FLT`.
* `projChart_jacobian_span_eq_top` (LEAF B) — the two chart partials generate the unit
  ideal.  This is where `hjac`, and hence `Δ`, is consumed.
* `isStandardSmoothOfRelativeDimension_projChartAway` (**PROVEN**) — on each of the two
  localisations the `2 × 2` Jacobian of the relations `(wᵢ, t·∂wᵢ/∂u - 1)` in the generators
  `(u, v, t)` is triangular with determinant `(∂wᵢ/∂u)²`, a unit there, so the presentation
  is submersive of dimension `3 - 2 = 1`.

Leaves A and B each carry their own proof plan; see their docstrings.  A Gröbner computation confirms the
Jacobian ideal of each of the three charts is the unit ideal over `ℚ(a₁, …, a₆)` and is
PROPER over `ℚ[a₁, …, a₆]`, so no chart is exceptional and none of this is vacuous. -/

/-- **The projective Weierstrass model is smooth of relative dimension
`1` over `Spec ℚ`** (sorry node — item 7a).

CORRECTION to the item-7 note in `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`'s
docstring, and a sharpening rather than a restatement: the Jacobian
criterion is NOT absent from this pin.  `Mathlib/RingTheory/Smooth/Local.lean`
states it for LOCAL ALGEBRAS and `Smooth/StandardSmoothOfFree.lean` carries
`isUnit_jacobian_of_cotangentRestrict_bijective`.  What is missing is a
`Proj`-level formulation, so the task here is to DESCEND the local
criterion along the standard affine cover of `Proj` — `Proj.awayι` and
`Proj.affineOpenCover` — not to build a criterion from nothing.

On each affine chart the partial derivatives of the Weierstrass
polynomial generate the unit ideal exactly when `Δ` is invertible, which
is `E.IsElliptic`.  This is where ellipticity is genuinely used, and it
is the only place the discriminant enters.

## What is PROVEN here and what remains

The **reduction to the three coordinate charts is now proven**, and it is the whole
of the glue: `SmoothOfRelativeDimension n` has a `HasRingHomProperty`, hence is
Zariski-local at the SOURCE, so `IsZariskiLocalAtSource.of_openCover` reduces the
claim to the charts of any affine open cover.  The cover used is
`Proj.affineOpenCoverOfIrrelevantLESpan` at the three images `x₀, x₁, x₂` of the
coordinates — i.e. `D₊(X)`, `D₊(Y)`, `D₊(Z)` — rather than mathlib's default
`Proj.affineOpenCover`, whose index set is ALL homogeneous elements of positive
degree and which would therefore leave a strictly harder residual obligation.

Both side conditions of that cover are discharged:

* the degree condition `xᵢ ∈ projGrading E 1`, from
  `HomogeneousIdeal.mk_mem_quotientGrading` and `MvPolynomial.isHomogeneous_X`;
* the covering condition `(projGrading E)₊ ≤ span {x₀, x₁, x₂}`, via
  `HomogeneousIdeal.toIdeal_irrelevant_le` (which reduces it to homogeneous elements
  of positive degree) and `MvPolynomial.mem_ideal_span_X_image` (a polynomial lies in
  the ideal generated by the variables iff every monomial of its support involves
  one) — a homogeneous polynomial of degree `i > 0` has no constant monomial, so it
  qualifies.

**`hchart` is now proven too, modulo ONE named leaf.**  The chart obligation has been
reduced all the way to a ring-hom property, and the Jacobian criterion — the part that
actually uses `Δ` — is PROVEN:

* `awayι_projToSpec_eq_specMap` — by `Proj.awayι_toSpecZero`, the chart composite
  `Spec ((A_{xᵢ})₀) ⟶ Proj 𝒜 ⟶ Spec ℚ` IS `Spec.map` of the ring map `ℚ → (A_{xᵢ})₀`,
  so the residual obligation is purely RING-THEORETIC;
* `smoothOfRelativeDimension_specMap_of_locally` — for such a `Spec.map`,
  `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1` is exactly `Locally (IsStandardSmoothOfRelativeDimension 1)`
  of that ring map, by `HasRingHomProperty.Spec_iff`;
* `jacobianSpan_eq_top` — **where `Δ` enters, and PROVEN over an ARBITRARY commutative
  ring**: at any point of the curve the two partial derivatives generate the unit ideal.
  It is handed to the leaf as the hypothesis `hjac`, so the discriminant is genuinely
  consumed rather than merely available.

The single remaining leaf is `locally_isStandardSmooth_awayCoord`, and what it needs is a
piece of MATHLIB infrastructure rather than any further elliptic-curve mathematics: the
dehomogenisation isomorphism between the degree-zero part of `(ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W))_{xᵢ}` and
`ℚ[u, v] ⧸ (wᵢ)`.  Its own docstring states precisely what is missing and how the
remaining pieces fit.  Concretely, for `i = 2` the target ring is
`ℚ[x, y] ⧸ (y² + a₁xy + a₃y − x³ − a₂x² − a₄x − a₆)`. -/

/-- **The projective Weierstrass model is geometrically connected over
`Spec ℚ`** (sorry node — item 7b).

The base change to `ℚ̄` is `Proj` of `ℚ̄[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W)`, and `W` is an
irreducible cubic there — a reducible plane cubic is singular at an
intersection point of two components, contradicting
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec` — so the coordinate ring is a
domain, and `Proj` of a graded domain is irreducible, hence connected.
Nonemptiness, which `GeometricallyConnected` demands through
`ConnectedSpace`, is the point at infinity.

## What is PROVEN here and what remains

The **reduction to a single base change is now proven**.  `GeometricallyConnected` is
by definition `geometrically (ConnectedSpace ·)`, i.e. a condition on `X ×_ℚ Spec K`
for EVERY field `K` with a map `Spec K ⟶ Spec ℚ`; since the base is affine and
`(ConnectedSpace ·)` is closed under isomorphism,
`geometrically_iff_of_commRing_of_isClosedUnderIsomorphisms` turns that into: for
every field `K` with `[Algebra ℚ K]`, the pullback along
`Spec.map (algebraMap ℚ K)` is connected.

Note this is genuinely a statement about ALL field extensions `K/ℚ`, not only about
`ℚ̄` — the docstring above is right that `ℚ̄` is where the geometry happens, but the
quantifier is not eliminable at this stage, so the remaining leaves are stated over a
general `K`.  That costs nothing: the cubic is irreducible over every extension of a
field over which it is smooth, so the same argument serves.

**Three sorries remain**, and the assembly consumes exactly these:

* `hbc` — the base change of the projective model is the projective model of the
  base-changed curve, `Proj (ℚ[X,Y,Z]⧸(W)) ×_ℚ Spec K ≅ Proj (K[X,Y,Z]⧸(W_K))`.  This
  is `Proj` commuting with base change of the graded ring, plus
  `WeierstrassCurve.baseChange` commuting with `polynomial`.  It carries no
  ellipticity.
* `hne` — nonemptiness, which is the point at infinity `[0 : 1 : 0]`.
* `hpre` — preconnectedness, which is the real content: `W_K` is an irreducible cubic
  (a reducible plane cubic is singular at an intersection of two components,
  contradicting `smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec` after base change), so the
  coordinate ring is a domain and `Proj` of a graded domain is irreducible.

Splitting `ConnectedSpace` into `Nonempty` and `PreconnectedSpace` is deliberate: the
two halves have nothing to do with each other, and bundling them would have forced a
successor to redo the trivial half. -/

(PROVEN) — the morphism-level bridge, applied.

Everything here is formal: `ofMorphisms` turns the data of `ProjGroupLaw`
into the functor-of-points presentation the moduli argument consumes, and
its two naturality fields cost the caller nothing.  `Smooth` is obtained
from `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1` by `SmoothOfRelativeDimension.smooth`,
so smoothness is asserted once rather than twice. -/

/-! ### Compatibility of the morphism-level law with the `RelPoint` presentation

**This is the reusable payoff of stating the group law as morphisms.**
Every existing consumer in `X0.lean` and the moduli argument downstream is
written against `RelPoint`, not against `m`, `e`, `i`; so a producer that
hands over a `ProjGroupLaw` needs to know what the resulting `+`, `0` and
`-` on `RelPoint (projToSpec E) g` actually *are*.

All four lemmas below are definitional — `ofMorphisms` sets its `add`,
`zero` and `neg` fields to `addOfMor`, `zeroOfMor` and `negOfMor`, whose
values are `relPair x y ≫ m`, `g ≫ e` and `x.1 ≫ i` — but they are worth
stating, because after `toAbelianSchemeStruct` the underlying morphisms are
buried three definitions deep and no consumer should have to unfold
`ofMorphisms` by hand to reach them.  With these in place a `T`-point
computation on the projective model is a computation with `gl.m`, `gl.e`
and `gl.i` in the category of schemes, which is the only form in which the
chord–tangent formulas can be applied. -/

/-- **The geometric fibre of the projective Weierstrass model IS `E(ℚ̄)`,
equivariantly** (sorry node — item 8).

This is the conjunct that pins the scheme as *this* curve rather than
some elliptic curve: without it the node would be satisfiable by any
elliptic curve over `ℚ` whatsoever, and the bridge in `X0.lean` would
then manufacture a `Γ₀(N)`-datum out of the wrong curve.

Two halves, and only the first is missing.  The FIELD-level half is
already at this pin: `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.toAffineAddEquiv` gives
`W.Point ≃+ W.toAffine.Point` over a field.  What has to be supplied is
the identification of `Spec ℚ̄`-points of `proj E` with the projective
points `(E⁄ℚ̄).Point` — that a morphism `Spec ℚ̄ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` over `Spec ℚ` is
a homogeneous prime together with a `ℚ̄`-valued homogeneous coordinate.
For a `Proj` over a FIELD that is the classical description, and it does
NOT require the general `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` that is missing at this pin —
which is precisely why item 8 is a leaf rather than another instance of
the structural obstruction.

Galois equivariance is then automatic: `galSMul` is precomposition with
`Spec σ` (`AbelianSchemeStruct.galSMul_def`), and under the coordinate
description that is the coordinatewise action of `σ` on `[x : y : z]`,
which is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.map`.

Additivity is where the group law re-enters: the `≃+` must intertwine
`gl.m` with the chord–tangent law on `(E⁄ℚ̄).Point`, which on `ℚ̄`-points
is the defining property of the addition formulas.  So this leaf consumes
`ProjGroupLaw`'s DATA — hence the `gl` argument — but nothing of its
axioms beyond what `toAbelianSchemeStruct` already packages.

It is stated OUTSIDE the `open WeierstrassCurve.Projective` section
above: that namespace carries its own scoped `⁄` notation for
`baseChange`, which would make `E⁄(AlgebraicClosure ℚ)` ambiguous against
the `WeierstrassCurve.Affine` one this file opens at the top.  Hence the
qualified `projToSpec`. -/
