# Good reduction implies flat torsion

Let `E` be an elliptic curve over the field of fractions `K` of a discrete valuation
ring `R`, suppose that `E` has good reduction over `R`, and let `n ≥ 1` be a natural
number. Then the `n`-torsion of `E` "is a finite flat group scheme": the Galois module
`E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]` is, Galois-equivariantly, the group of `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points of the generic fibre
of a finite flat group scheme over `R`.

Mathlib has no group schemes, so we speak throughout of the (commutative) Hopf algebra
of functions on the group scheme instead: the statement below produces a commutative
Hopf algebra `H` over `R`, finite and flat as an `R`-module (`R` is a DVR, so this
says finite free; over a general base the right condition is finite locally free),
together with a Galois-equivariant isomorphism of groups from the `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points
`K ⊗[R] H →ₐ[K] Kˢᵉᵖ` of its generic fibre (a group under convolution, `K ⊗[R] H`
being a Hopf algebra over `K`) to the `n`-torsion subgroup of `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)`.

## Mathematical discussion: what is the correct generality?

Good reduction means that the minimal Weierstrass equation of `E` has unit discriminant
over `R`, so it defines an elliptic scheme (an abelian scheme of relative dimension 1)
`𝓔` over `R` with generic fibre `E`. Multiplication by `n` on an elliptic scheme is a
finite locally free morphism of degree `n²` for every `n ≥ 1` [Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic
moduli of elliptic curves*, Theorem 2.3.1], so its kernel `𝓔[n]` is a finite flat group
scheme over `R` of order `n²` with generic fibre `E[n]`. This is the robust form of the
statement: it holds for every `n` over any DVR (indeed over any base scheme), in every
characteristic.

The statement formalised below is instead about the Galois module `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]`, because
mathlib cannot yet express `E[n]` as a group scheme. How the two statements compare
depends on whether `n` is invertible in `K`:

* If `n` is invertible in `K` then `E[n]` is a finite étale group scheme over `K` of
  order `n²`. It is therefore determined by its Galois module of `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points, which is
  free of rank 2 over `ℤ/nℤ`, and the statement below carries the full content of the
  group-scheme statement.

* If `K` has characteristic `p` and `p ∣ n` then `E[n]` is not étale, and `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]`
  sees only its maximal étale quotient (for `n = p`: a group of order `p` if the
  reduction is ordinary and of order `1` if it is supersingular). The statement below
  should still be true — for `H` one can take the Cartier dual of the schematic closure
  in `𝓔[n]` of the Cartier dual of the maximal étale quotient of `E[n]` — but it is
  strictly weaker than flatness of `E[n]` itself. The honest statement in this case is
  the group-scheme statement of the previous paragraph, which cannot yet be formalised.

Which values of `n` make flatness interesting? Let `p` denote the characteristic of the
residue field of `R`.

* If `n` is invertible in the residue field then the conclusion is equivalent to the
  Galois module `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]` being unramified, which is the statement of
  `FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.GoodReduction`. Indeed, the order of a finite flat
  group scheme kills its module of invariant differentials [Tate, *Finite flat group
  schemes*, in *Modular forms and Fermat's Last Theorem*], so a finite flat group scheme
  over `R` whose order is invertible in `R` is unramified over `R`, hence finite étale;
  and finite étale group schemes over `R` are the same thing as unramified Galois
  modules, via normalization. In particular "unramified implies flat" holds for *any*
  finite abelian Galois module of order invertible in the residue field, for reasons
  having nothing to do with elliptic curves.

* The interesting case is therefore `p > 0` and `p ∣ n`, where flatness is genuinely
  stronger than anything expressible via ramification: for `K` of characteristic zero
  (e.g. a finite extension of `ℚ_p`) and `n = p`, this is the sense in which "`ρ` is
  flat at `p`" is used for mod `p` representations in [Serre, *Sur les représentations
  modulaires de degré 2 de Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)*, Duke Math. J. 54 (1987), §2.8] and in the
  modularity lifting literature, and it matches the definition `GaloisRep.IsFlatAt` in
  `FLT.Deformations.RepresentationTheory.GaloisRep` (stated there for number fields; the
  theorem below is the local statement feeding into it). Note that flat does *not* imply
  unramified here: the `p`-torsion of a curve with good reduction is flat but in general
  highly ramified at `p`.

The `Algebra.Etale K (K ⊗[R] H)` condition below pins down the generic fibre as the
finite étale group scheme attached to the Galois module `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]` (in particular it
forces the `R`-rank of `H` to equal the number of `n`-torsion points). It is automatic
when `K` has characteristic zero, by Cartier's theorem that finite group schemes in
characteristic zero are étale, and it is what makes the equivalence "flat ⟺ unramified"
above honest; compare the corresponding condition in `GaloisRep.HasFlatProlongationAt`.

## TODO

* `FLT.GroupScheme.FiniteFlat` plans a definition of what it means for an action of
  `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)` on a finite abelian group to be *flat*, for `K` the field of fractions
  of a DVR. Once that definition exists, the conclusion below should be refactored to
  "the Galois module `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[n]` is flat".

* Once `E[n]` can be expressed as a group scheme (equivalently, once its Hopf algebra of
  functions is available), state the stronger result that `E[n]` itself, not just its
  Galois module of points, prolongs to a finite flat group scheme over `R`; as explained
  above, this is insensitive to the characteristic of `K`.

* The division polynomial lemma `WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`, which isolates the
  arithmetic input to the theorem as a purely polynomial statement, is PROVEN and now
  lives upstream in `Fermat.FLT.EllipticCurve.PhiPsiCoprime` (see the note at the bottom
  of this file).

### Arithmetic helpers: splitting `n` into a unit part and a residue-characteristic part

Over a local ring `R`, at most one prime number `p` can fail to be a unit (two distinct
primes satisfy a Bézout identity over `ℤ`, and the two generators of a Bézout identity
cannot both lie in the maximal ideal), so every `n ≥ 1` factors as `n = p ^ k * m` with
`IsUnit (m : R)` and `p ∤ m`. The two lemmas below provide the glue for this reduction;
they are consumed by the case split in `WeierstrassCurve.torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`.

### Decomposition of the étale case: Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich plus descent

The étale leaf `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction_of_isUnit` splits into an
elliptic-curve half — inertia above `R` acts trivially on the `m`-torsion, the easy
direction of Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich, proven in
`Fermat.FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.GoodReduction` for odd primes and reduced
below to its prime-power core by a proven CRT/Bézout argument — and a pure descent
half: an unramified torsion Galois module of order invertible in the residue field
prolongs to a finite étale (in particular finite flat) Hopf algebra over `R`. The
assembly is proven; the two remaining sorries in this subsection are the prime-power
Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich core and the descent statement, neither of which mentions the
other's mathematics.
-/

/-- **Reduction is injective on prime-power torsion, deep cases** (sorry node): two
`p ^ k`-torsion points of `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)` with integral coordinates and congruent residues in
a valuation subring `𝒪` above `R` are equal, for `p ^ k` invertible in `R` and either
`p = 2` or `k ≥ 2` (the case `p` odd, `k = 1` is PROVEN — via
`WeierstrassCurve.torsion_abscissa_residue_ne` and
`WeierstrassCurve.torsion_ordinate_eq_of_residue_eq` in
`Fermat.FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.GoodReduction` — and is consumed by the
assembly below through `torsion_unramified_of_good_reduction`, so it is excluded here).

Intended proof (dévissage to the prime layer plus a formal-group valuation estimate):
the difference `T = P₁ - P₂` of two congruent integral torsion points lies in the
"kernel of reduction" — concretely, if `T ≠ 0` its abscissa has negative valuation:
in the chord construction for `P₁ + (-P₂)` the denominator `x₁ - x₂ ∈ 𝔪` while the
numerator is congruent to `ψ₂(P₂) mod 𝔪`, giving `v(x(T)) = 2 v(λ) < 0` when
`ψ₂(P₂) ∉ 𝔪`, with the near-2-torsion case `ψ₂(P₂) ∈ 𝔪` handled by comparing the
valuations of the two ordinate roots (for `p = 2` this ordinate-flip analysis is the
whole content). On the other hand a suitable multiple `p ^ j • T` is a NONZERO
`p`-torsion point (tower dévissage), whose abscissa is a root of `ΨSq p` — of unit
leading coefficient `p²` since `p ∈ Rˣ` — hence integral over `𝒪`: contradiction.
The division-polynomial coprimality input at composite order, `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq`, is
proven (`Fermat.FLT.EllipticCurve.PhiPsiCoprime`; over the residue field `Δ` is a unit
by good reduction). -/

/-- **The finite étale Hopf package of the torsion over the fraction field** (sorry
node; the Galois-theory half, shared by the étale case below and the mixed-characteristic
branch of the residue-characteristic case — nothing DVR-arithmetic remains in its
intended proof): for `m` nonzero in `R`, the `m`-torsion Galois module `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[m]` is,
`Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)`-equivariantly, the group of `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points of a finite étale Hopf algebra
over `K`. Intended proof (Grothendieck's Galois correspondence for étale `K`-algebras,
with group structure): `H_K` is the algebra of `Gal(Kˢᵉᵖ/K)`-equivariant maps
`E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[m] → Kˢᵉᵖ`; the torsion is finite (division polynomials) and the action is
discrete (a torsion point is fixed by the fixing subgroup of the finite extension
generated by its coordinates), so evaluation at orbit representatives identifies `H_K`
with a finite product `∏_{orbits} Fix(Stab)` of finite separable subextensions of
`Kˢᵉᵖ/K` — finite étale of `K`-dimension `#E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[m]` — and the comultiplication is
the pullback of the group law through the same identification for `H_K ⊗[K] H_K`. The
universe-`u` carrier is legitimate because `K` is the fraction field of `R : Type u`
(transport along a `K`-basis realizes the algebra on `Fin d → FractionRing R`). The
structurally parallel sorry node `exists_galoisModulePackage_of_finiteQuotient` in
`Fermat.FLT.FreyCurve.Semistable` (downstream, hence not importable here) proves the
same correspondence over `ℚ`; when one of the two is resolved the other should be
derived from or aligned with it. -/

/-- **Unramified implies étale prolongation** (sorry node; the DVR-arithmetic half of
the étale case — nothing about elliptic curves remains in its intended proof beyond the
package interface): given the finite étale Hopf `K`-algebra `HK` of the `m`-torsion
(the leaf above), if every inertia subgroup above `R` acts trivially on `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[m]`
and `m` is invertible in `R`, then `HK` prolongs to a finite étale (in particular
finite flat) Hopf algebra over `R`. Intended proof: take `H` to be the integral closure
of `R` in `HK` (transported to `Type u` along an `R`-basis): `HK` is a finite product
of finite separable subextensions of `Kˢᵉᵖ/K`, each split by the splitting field of the
torsion, which is unramified over `K` by the hypothesis transported through `f`/`hf`
(its inertia acts trivially on the points of `HK`), so the normalization of `R` in each
factor is finite étale over `R` (unramified + flat: a DVR normalization in an
unramified extension is monogenic with separable residue algebra), the natural map
`K ⊗[R] H → HK` is an isomorphism, and comultiplication preserves integrality because
`H ⊗[R] H` is the integral closure of `R` in `HK ⊗[K] HK` (étale ⊗ étale is étale, and
integral closure commutes with the product decomposition). -/

`H := H_a ⊗[R] H_b` with the tensor-product Hopf structure; finiteness and flatness of a
tensor product of finite flat modules are standard, étaleness of
`K ⊗[R] (H_a ⊗[R] H_b) ≅ (K ⊗[R] H_a) ⊗[K] (K ⊗[R] H_b)` is stability of étale algebras
under base change and tensor product, `K`-algebra homomorphisms out of a tensor product
are pairs of homomorphisms (`Algebra.TensorProduct.lift`, an iso of convolution groups
here), and `AddSubgroup.torsionBy (a*b) ≃ torsionBy a × torsionBy b` for coprime `a`, `b`
is the Chinese remainder theorem for the divisible-by-`n` filtration of an abelian group

/-- **The Katz–Mazur flat prolongation, mixed characteristic** (sorry node; the
mathematical core of flatness at `p`): given the finite étale Hopf `K`-algebra `HK` of
the `p ^ k`-torsion (the shared Galois-correspondence leaf
`exists_torsion_etale_package_over_fractionField`), when the prime `p` is *not*
invertible in `R` but nonzero in `K` (so `p` is the residue characteristic and `K` has
characteristic `0` or prime-to-`p`; for the Frey curve application `R = ℤ_(p)`,
`K = ℚ`, `k = 1`), `HK` prolongs to a finite FLAT — no longer étale — Hopf algebra over
`R`. Unlike the unramified case, `H` is NOT the normalization: division polynomials
cannot produce `H` here (part of the torsion group scheme sits in the kernel of
reduction, outside the affine chart), and the integral closure of `R` in `HK` is in
general not a Hopf algebra (for `μ_p` over `ℤ_p` the normalization has a special fibre
with two connected components of lengths `1` and `p - 1`, which is not a group scheme).
The intended construction is the schematic one of [Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic moduli of
elliptic curves*, Thm 2.3.1]: good reduction makes the minimal Weierstrass equation an
elliptic scheme `𝓔` over `R`; multiplication by `p ^ k` on `𝓔` is finite locally free
of degree `p ^ (2k)` — the arithmetic input being that `(Φ n).eval X - ξ * (ΨSq n).eval X`
is monic of degree `n²` over `R[ξ]` together with the fibrewise coprimality
`isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq` (proven, `Fermat.FLT.EllipticCurve.PhiPsiCoprime`) — and `H` is the
affine algebra of its kernel `𝓔[p ^ k]`, glued from the division-polynomial chart and
a formal-group chart `R[[T]]/([p ^ k](T))` at the origin; the identification of
`K ⊗[R] H` with `HK` is Cartier's theorem (étaleness of the generic fibre) plus the
matching of `Kˢᵉᵖ`-points with the torsion. -/

which has `K = ℚ`). Here `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)[p ^ k]` sees only the maximal étale quotient of the
`p ^ k`-torsion group scheme — a group of order `p ^ k` (ordinary reduction) or `1`

### A step towards the proof, via division polynomials

Mathlib knows the division polynomials of a Weierstrass curve `W` over any commutative
ring: `W.Φ n` is monic of degree `n²`, and `W.ΨSq n` has degree `n² - 1` with leading
coefficient `n²` (see `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/`, in
particular `natDegree_Φ`, `natDegree_ΨSq` and `leadingCoeff_ΨSq`). What mathlib does not
yet know is the dictionary between division polynomials and torsion: for a point `P ≠ 0`
of `E` over a field, `n • P = 0` iff `ΨSq n` vanishes at `x(P)`, and more generally
`x(n • P) = (Φ n).eval x(P) / (ΨSq n).eval x(P)`.

The two lemmas below isolate the arithmetic input to `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` as
a purely polynomial statement: the resultant of `Φ n` and `ΨSq n` is `±Δ ^ ((n⁴ - n²)/6)`;
in particular the two polynomials are coprime whenever `Δ` is a unit.

Why the identity is true: over a field on which `Δ` is invertible, a common root of `Φ n`
and `ΨSq n` would — via the dictionary and the definition
`Φ n = X * ΨSq n - preΨ (n+1) * preΨ (n-1) * (1 or Ψ₂Sq)` — be the `x`-coordinate of a
nonzero `n`-torsion point which is also `(n+1)`- or `(n-1)`-torsion, hence trivial, a
contradiction. So over `ℤ[a₁, …, a₆]`, where `Δ` is irreducible, the resultant is forced
to be `±c * Δ ^ k` with `c` an integer; running the same no-common-root argument over
`𝔽ₗ` for every prime `ℓ` (it is insensitive to the characteristic) gives `c = ±1`; and
weights (`aᵢ` has weight `i`, `x` has weight `2`, `Δ` has weight `12`, and the resultant
is isobaric of weight `2 * n² * (n² - 1)`) pin `k = (n⁴ - n²)/6`. Sanity check for
`n = 2`, `y² = x³ - x`: `Φ₂ = (x² + 1)²`, `Ψ₂² = 4(x³ - x)`, so the resultant is
`4⁴ * Φ₂(0) * Φ₂(1) * Φ₂(-1) = 4096 = Δ²`, and `(2⁴ - 2²)/6 = 2`.

Why it is a step towards `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction`:

* For `n` invertible in the residue field of `R`, the leading coefficient `n²` of
  `ΨSq n` is a unit of `R`, so the `x`-coordinates of the nonzero `n`-torsion points of
  `E(Kˢᵉᵖ)` (the roots of `ΨSq n`) are integral over `R`, and coprimality of `Φ n` and
  `ΨSq n` over the residue field (`Δ` is a unit there by good reduction) together with a
  companion identity for the discriminant of `ΨSq n` (of the same `±nᵃ * Δᵇ` shape) shows
  that reduction is injective on the `n`-torsion. Since inertia acts trivially on residue
  fields, it then acts trivially on the torsion: this is the unramifiedness statement of
  `FLT.KnownIn1980s.EllipticCurves.GoodReduction`, and by the discussion in the module
  docstring above (an unramified module of order invertible in the residue field prolongs
  étale-ly), it implies `torsion_flat_of_good_reduction` for all such `n`.

* For `n` divisible by the residue characteristic `p`, division polynomials cannot
  produce the Hopf algebra `H` by themselves: the leading coefficient `n²` of `ΨSq n`
  now lies in the maximal ideal, which is the concrete manifestation of the fact that
  part of the `n`-torsion group scheme sits at the origin, outside the affine chart
  where the division polynomials live (the torsion in the kernel of reduction has
  `x`-coordinates of negative valuation). But the identity is still the arithmetic core
  of the scheme-theoretic proof [Katz–Mazur, *Arithmetic moduli of elliptic curves*,
  Theorem 2.3.1] that multiplication by `n` on the elliptic scheme `𝓔` is finite locally
  free of degree `n²`: the polynomial `(Φ n).eval X - ξ * (ΨSq n).eval X` is monic of
  degree `n²` over `R[ξ]`, where `ξ = x ∘ [n]`, which gives finiteness of `[n]`, and
  coprimality on each fibre gives the constant fibre degree `n²`. So nothing proved here
  is wasted on the hard case.
