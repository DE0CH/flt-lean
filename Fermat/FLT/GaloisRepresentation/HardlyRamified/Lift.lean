Lift.lean — own work for the Fermat project (not vendored from the FLT
project).

The decomposition of **B5** ("hardly ramified mod-ℓ with ℓ ≥ 5 is not
irreducible") following the FLT project's plan (Buzzard, 2026 EPSRC course,
Lecture 4):

* **B6a** (`exists_hardlyRamifiedLift`, sorry node): an irreducible hardly
  ramified mod-`ℓ` representation lifts to a hardly ramified `ℓ`-adic
  representation over the integers `O` of a finite extension of `ℚ_ℓ`,
  compatibly with characteristic polynomials of Frobenius. The lift data is
  bundled in the structure `HardlyRamifiedLift`.

* **B6bc** (`residual_charFrob_eq`, sorry node): the residual
  characteristic polynomials of Frobenius of a liftable representation are
  those of `1 ⊕ χ̄` (i.e. `X² − (q+1)X + q` at `Frob_q`). Mathematically
  this is the composite of two further statements which a later layer must
  separate: the `ℓ`-adic lift spreads out into a weakly compatible family
  of hardly ramified `p`-adic representations over the completions of a
  number field (B6b, "spreading out" — provable *without* a residual
  modularity hypothesis, the 21st-century input), and any hardly ramified
  `3`-adic representation is an extension of the trivial character by the
  cyclotomic character (B6c), which pins the traces of the whole family.

* **Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt** (`not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq`, sorry
  node): a continuous mod-`ℓ` representation whose Frobenius characteristic
  polynomials away from `{2, 3, ℓ}` are those of `1 ⊕ χ̄` is not
  irreducible: the Frobenii are dense (Chebotarev), so all characteristic
  polynomials agree with those of `1 ⊕ χ̄`, and Brauer–Nesbitt forces the
  semisimplification to be `1 ⊕ χ̄`, which is reducible.

Given these, B5 is proven in `Reducible.lean`.

/-- **B6a** (sorry node): an irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ`
representation with `ℓ ≥ 5` admits a hardly ramified `ℓ`-adic lift.

This is a modularity-lifting-style deformation-theoretic statement with no
residual modularity hypothesis (the hypothesis is replaced by "the residual
representation is valued in `GL₂(ℤ/ℓℤ)`"). -/

/-- **B6b + B6c** (sorry node, to be split by a later layer): the residual
characteristic polynomials of Frobenius of a liftable hardly ramified
representation are those of `1 ⊕ χ̄`, i.e. `X² − (q+1)X + q` at `Frob_q`.

Route: the `ℓ`-adic lift spreads out into a weakly compatible family of
hardly ramified `p`-adic representations over the completions of a number
field (B6b); the `3`-adic member is an extension of the trivial character
by the cyclotomic character (B6c), so its Frobenius traces at `q ∉ {2,3}`
are `q + 1`; by compatibility the same holds for the `ℓ`-adic member and
hence residually. -/
