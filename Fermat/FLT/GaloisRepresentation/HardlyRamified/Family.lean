# Hardly ramified representations in compatible families

We show that the property of being hardly ramified is preserved within
compatible families of Galois representations.

VENDORING CHANGES: (1) the conclusion of `mem_isCompatible` (originally
an anonymous `∃`-package) is extracted into the named predicate
`IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily`, so that downstream nodes (the compatibility
bookkeeping in `Lift.lean`) can take it as a hypothesis without
duplicating the package verbatim. (2) 2026-07-16: the package is
STRENGTHENED by recording that the coefficient rings embed into the
`p`-adic algebraic closures (`Function.Injective (algebraMap ...)`, two
occurrences below): the upstream statement omits this, but the charpoly
descent in `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` requires it and it holds for
the intended coefficient rings (subrings of `ℚ̄_p`). This strengthens
what B6b must prove, deliberately.

AUDIT (2026-07-22): **the hypotheses of `mem_isCompatible` do not rule
out coefficient rings of characteristic `p`, and for those the
conclusion is false** — take `p = 3`, `R = 𝔽₃` (with the discrete =
`ℤ₃`-module topology; it is a local domain, module-finite over `ℤ₃`)
and `ρ = 1 ⊕ χ̄₃` acting diagonally on `Fin 2 → 𝔽₃`: this `ρ` is hardly
ramified (cyclotomic determinant, unramified outside `{2,3}`, flat at
`3` via `μ₃ ⊕ ℤ/3`, tame at `2` with quotient character `χ̄₃|_{G₂}`,
which is unramified with square one), yet the membership clause of
`IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily` demands `∃ (_ : Algebra R ℚ̄_p)` — and there
is no ring hom `𝔽₃ →+* ℚ̄₃` at all (`(1 : ℚ̄₃)` does not have additive
order `3`). The same defect is present in the upstream FLT project's
statement. The intended reading ("`R` is the integers in a finite
extension of `ℚ_p`") forces `algebraMap ℤ_[p] R` to be injective, and
the sole consumer (`residual_charFrob_eq` in `Lift.lean`) instantiates
`R` with such a ring.

RESTATEMENT (2026-07-22, coordinated with the call site in
`Lift.lean`): `mem_isCompatible` now takes the extra hypothesis
`hZinj : Function.Injective (algebraMap ℤ_[p] R)`, which repairs the
defect. The previous revision quarantined exactly this statement as an
inner *sorried step* `hZinj` of the proof skeleton (recording that it
was false-as-stated in full generality); that sorry is superseded by —
and deleted in favour of — the hypothesis. At the sole call site
(`residual_charFrob_eq` in `Lift.lean`) the hypothesis is discharged
by the `algebraMap_injective` field of `HardlyRamifiedLift`, which
holds for the intended `L.O` (integers in a finite extension of
`ℚ_p`). From `hZinj` the coefficient embedding `R ↪ ℚ̄_p` is *proven*
(torsion-free + integral ⇒ `IsAlgClosed.lift`; injectivity by
contracting the kernel to `ℤ_[p]`; continuity from the module
topology). The remaining sorried step `hcore` is the true
automorphy/modularity content of B6b.

integrality stratum `charFrob_coeff_isIntegralElem`), and a finite
extension of `ℚ_p` contains algebraic-over-`ℚ` subfields of infinite
degree, so the finite-degree bound is not formal — it is the statement
that the Frobenius traces are the Hecke eigenvalues of a cuspidal
eigenform, which generate a number field (the Hecke field). The
number-field/embedding/polynomial *packaging* of this statement is
proven downstream in `exists_numberField_eigensystem`; this leaf is the

/-- **Eigensystem stratum** (sorry node): the Frobenius characteristic
polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation over a
characteristic-zero coefficient ring embedded in `ℚ̄_p` descend, away
from a finite set of places, to a single **number field** `E`.

This is the trace-level shadow of "`ρ` is congruent to a cuspidal Hecke
eigenform": the number field `E` is the Hecke field, `Pv v` is
`X² − a_v X + q_v`, and the finite exceptional set is the level. The
genuine content is the *algebraicity and finiteness* of the trace field:
the Frobenius traces of `ρ` live in the module-finite `ℤ_p`-algebra `R`,
hence in a finite extension of `ℚ_p` — but a finite extension of `ℚ_p`
contains algebraic subfields of infinite degree over `ℚ`, so the
existence of a *number* field `E` capturing all of them (with a single
embedding `ψ` matching the two sides) is not formal; it is where the
automorphy of `ρ` first enters (Hecke eigenvalues are algebraic integers
generating a finite extension).

VOCABULARY NOTE (2026-07-22): the mathlib pin has modular forms
(`CuspForm` etc.) but no Hecke operators, no eigenforms and no attached
Galois representations, so the requested "cuspidal eigenform congruence"
split can only be stated at this trace level; this leaf is its faithful
shadow in the available vocabulary.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22) into a PROVEN assembly over two strata:

1. `charFrob_coeff_isIntegralElem` (PROVEN) — the coefficients are
   integral over `ℤ_[p]` (formal, from module-finiteness of `R`).
2. `exists_finiteDimensional_coeff_field` (sorry node) — the
   coefficients lie, away from finitely many places, in a subfield of
   `ℚ̄_p` finite over `ℚ`. The sole surviving automorphy content at
   this level.
3. The packaging (PROVEN, below): the intermediate field is upgraded to
   an abstract `NumberField` in the required universe via `ULift`, the
   embedding `ψ` is the inclusion, and the polynomials `Pv` are
   rebuilt over the subfield coefficient-by-coefficient
   (`Polynomial.as_sum_support_C_mul_X_pow`), with value `0` at the
   finitely many exceptional places. -/

/-- **Spreading stratum** (sorry node): a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation whose Frobenius characteristic polynomials descend to a
number field `E` spreads out into a compatible family of Galois
representations with hardly ramified odd-residue-characteristic members,
containing `ρ` as its member at some embedding of (a possibly larger)
number field into `ℚ̄_p`.

This is the construction of the compatible family attached to the
eigensystem — Eichler–Shimura/Deligne's construction of the `λ`-adic
representations attached to the eigenform underlying the eigensystem,
plus local-global compatibility (Carayol, Saito) and the weight-2,
level-2 analysis showing each odd-residue member is hardly ramified.
The eigensystem hypothesis `heig` is the data the construction consumes;
the conclusion is stated verbatim as the automorphy core of
`mem_isCompatible` below.

DECOMPOSITION AUDIT (2026-07-22, recording a rejected alternative): the
seemingly natural split "(i) `ρ` lies in *some* compatible family; (ii)
any compatible family with one hardly ramified member has hardly
ramified odd members" is UNSOUND at (ii): `GaloisRepFamily.isCompatible`
pins only charpoly data outside a finite set, so a compatible family
containing the hardly ramified member `1 ⊕ χ_p` can place at another
prime a *non-semisimple* extension of `1` by `χ_ℓ` ramified at an
auxiliary prime (a Kummer class of `5`, say) — same Frobenius
charpolys, but ramified outside `{2, ℓ}`, hence not isomorphic to any
hardly ramified representation. The eigensystem/spreading split used
here avoids quantifying over abstract families in the hypotheses. -/

/-- **B6b**: a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation over a
coefficient ring of characteristic zero (`hZinj`: `ℤ_[p]` embeds — the
audit hypothesis added 2026-07-22, without which the statement is false;
see the module docstring) lives in a compatible family of Galois
representations, all of whose odd-residue-characteristic members are
themselves hardly ramified.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22) into a compiling skeleton with one sorried step
(a second sorried step, the false-as-stated injectivity of
`algebraMap ℤ_[p] R`, was the quarantine of the audit defect and is
superseded by the hypothesis `hZinj`):

1. `hembed` — from `hZinj`, the coefficient embedding `R ↪ ℚ̄_p`
   (injective, `ℤ_[p]`-compatible, continuous) is PROVEN.
2. the automorphy core — given the fixed continuous embedding
   `R ↪ ℚ̄_p` (as the `Algebra R ℚ̄_p` instance `ia` in context), the
   hardly ramified `ρ` extends to a compatible family `σ` over a number
   field `E` with hardly ramified odd members, and `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` is the
   member at some `ψ : E →+* ℚ̄_p`. FURTHER DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22)
   into the two sorried strata above: the eigensystem stratum
   (`exists_numberField_eigensystem` — the Frobenius data descend to a
   number field, i.e. the Hecke-field/eigenform-congruence content) and
   the spreading stratum (`exists_family_of_eigensystem` — the
   compatible family attached to the eigensystem, i.e.
   Eichler–Shimura/Deligne plus local-global compatibility).

NOTE (elaboration): the final repackaging must be `refine` +
a deferred `exact` — an anonymous-constructor `exact ⟨…, ψ, r', hψ⟩`
against the `∃ (_ : Algebra R ℚ̄_p) …` telescope sends `isDefEq` into
a heartbeat timeout. -/
