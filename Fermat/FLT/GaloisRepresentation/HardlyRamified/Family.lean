# Hardly ramified representations in compatible families

We show that the property of being hardly ramified is preserved within
compatible families of Galois representations.

VENDORING CHANGES: (1) the conclusion of `mem_isCompatible` (originally
an anonymous `∃`-package) is extracted into the named predicate
`IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily`, so that downstream nodes (the compatibility
bookkeeping in `Lift.lean`) can take it as a hypothesis without
duplicating the package verbatim. (2) 2026-07-16: the package is
STRENGTHENED by recording that the coefficient rings embed into the
`p`-adic algebraic closures (`Function.Injective (algebraMap ...)`, two
occurrences below): the upstream statement omits this, but the charpoly
descent in `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` requires it and it holds for
the intended coefficient rings (subrings of `ℚ̄_p`). This strengthens
what B6b must prove, deliberately.

AUDIT (2026-07-22): **the hypotheses of `mem_isCompatible` do not rule
out coefficient rings of characteristic `p`, and for those the
conclusion is false** — take `p = 3`, `R = 𝔽₃` (with the discrete =
`ℤ₃`-module topology; it is a local domain, module-finite over `ℤ₃`)
and `ρ = 1 ⊕ χ̄₃` acting diagonally on `Fin 2 → 𝔽₃`: this `ρ` is hardly
ramified (cyclotomic determinant, unramified outside `{2,3}`, flat at
`3` via `μ₃ ⊕ ℤ/3`, tame at `2` with quotient character `χ̄₃|_{G₂}`,
which is unramified with square one), yet the membership clause of
`IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily` demands `∃ (_ : Algebra R ℚ̄_p)` — and there
is no ring hom `𝔽₃ →+* ℚ̄₃` at all (`(1 : ℚ̄₃)` does not have additive
order `3`). The same defect is present in the upstream FLT project's
statement. The intended reading ("`R` is the integers in a finite
extension of `ℚ_p`") forces `algebraMap ℤ_[p] R` to be injective, and
the sole consumer (`residual_charFrob_eq` in `Lift.lean`) instantiates
`R` with such a ring.

RESTATEMENT (2026-07-22, coordinated with the call site in
`Lift.lean`): `mem_isCompatible` now takes the extra hypothesis
`hZinj : Function.Injective (algebraMap ℤ_[p] R)`, which repairs the
defect. The previous revision quarantined exactly this statement as an
inner *sorried step* `hZinj` of the proof skeleton (recording that it
was false-as-stated in full generality); that sorry is superseded by —
and deleted in favour of — the hypothesis. At the sole call site
(`residual_charFrob_eq` in `Lift.lean`) the hypothesis is discharged
by the `algebraMap_injective` field of `HardlyRamifiedLift`, which
holds for the intended `L.O` (integers in a finite extension of
`ℚ_p`). From `hZinj` the coefficient embedding `R ↪ ℚ̄_p` is *proven*
(torsion-free + integral ⇒ `IsAlgClosed.lift`; injectivity by
contracting the kernel to `ℤ_[p]`; continuity from the module
topology). The remaining sorried step `hcore` is the true
automorphy/modularity content of B6b.

/-! ### Block-triangular linear algebra for the reducible branch

The mathlib pin has `LinearMap.det_eq_det_mul_det` (the determinant of
an endomorphism preserving a submodule is the product of the
determinants of the restriction and of the induced quotient map) but
no characteristic-polynomial analogue, and no API for evaluating the
`1`-dimensional blocks. The reducible-branch trace analysis below
reads the trace coefficient off the factored charpoly, so we prove the
charpoly analogue here by the same `Module.Basis.sumQuot` block-matrix
computation, together with the `1`-dimensional evaluation
`charpoly = X - C (trace)`. -/

endomorphism `e` preserves the submodule `W₀`, its characteristic

Charpoly analogue of the pin's `LinearMap.det_eq_det_mul_det`, proven
by the same block-matrix computation through the mixed basis

/-- **The cyclotomic character dies on inertia at `2`** (PROVEN
2026-07-24): for an odd prime `p`, the `p`-adic cyclotomic character is
trivial on the (image in `G_ℚ` of the) inertia at `2` — the extensions
`ℚ_2(μ_{p^n})/ℚ_2` are unramified, i.e. inertia at `2` acts trivially
on `p`-power roots of unity. Proof (the Frobenius-free core of
`adicArithFrob_rootsOfUnity_pow`, generalizing the `p = 3` case
`cyclotomicCharacter_algebraMap_eq_one_of_inertia_two` of ModThree):
a `p^n`-th root of unity `z` has spectral valuation `1`, so lies in
`Z2bar`, and an inertia element `τ` moves it by `v (τ z - z) < 1`; but
a NONtrivial `p`-power root of unity `u` has `v (u - 1) = 1` — by
`Polynomial.eval_one_cyclotomic_prime_pow` the product of `1 - μ` over
the primitive `p^m`-th roots is `p`, a `2`-adic unit since `p` is odd,
while every factor has `v ≤ 1`, forcing `v = 1` on each factor — so
`τ z = z` exactly. Hence every finite level of the cyclotomic
character is trivial (`modularCyclotomicCharacter.unique`) and
`p`-adic continuity (`PadicInt.ext_of_toZModPow`) concludes. -/

/-- **The tame-at-two triangular characteristic polynomial on inertia**
(PROVEN 2026-07-24): for a hardly ramified `ρ` and an inertia element
`τ` at `2` (spelled over `ℚ_[2]`, matching the `isTameAtTwo` clause),
the characteristic polynomial of `ρ` at the image of `τ` is
`(X - χ_cyc(τ))(X - 1)` over `R`. Pure linear algebra over the local
ring `R` plus the `IsHardlyRamified` clauses: the tame-at-two datum
`(π, δ)` exhibits `W := ker π` as a `ρ(G_2)`-stable direct summand of
`V` (finite and flat as a retract of `V` along the splitting through
any `π`-preimage of `1`, hence free of rank `1` over the local ring
`R` by `Module.free_of_flat_of_isLocalRing` and basis counting); on
`V ⧸ W ≅ R` the map `ρ τ` descends to `δ τ = 1` (inertia lies in
`δ.ker`), so the block-triangular factorization
`LinearMap.charpoly_eq_charpoly_restrict_mul_charpoly_mapQ` reads
`charpoly (ρ τ) = (X - C s)(X - C 1)` with `s` the trace of the
restriction to the line `W`; finally `s = det (ρ τ) = χ_cyc(τ)` by
reading the determinant off the constant coefficient
(`LinearMap.det_eq_sign_charpoly_coeff`) against the
cyclotomic-determinant clause. -/

2026-07-24, both sub-leaves discharged): second route stage
of `char_add_char_eq_one_add_cyclotomicCharacter`, per Serre (Duke

`localInertia_two_eq_map_padic` (ModThree) rewrites the place-spelled
inertia element as a `G_ℚ`-conjugate of a `ℚ_[2]`-spelled one, and
multiplicative characters into a commutative field are
conjugation-invariant; at the `ℚ_[2]`-spelled element the
characteristic polynomial is `(X - χ_cyc)(X - 1)` by the tame
triangularity (`charpoly_eq_of_mem_inertia_two`), and
`χ_cyc` is itself trivial there
(`cyclotomicCharacter_eq_one_of_mem_inertia_two`), so the split mapped
characteristic polynomial reads `(X - χ₁)(X - χ₂) = (X - 1)²` and
evaluation kills both characters, as in

/-- **The flat inertia charpoly at `p`** (sorry node — the
Raynaud/Fontaine input of the reducible branch, isolated at a single
inertia element): for a hardly ramified (flat-at-`p`,
cyclotomic-determinant) `ρ` whose mapped characteristic polynomials
split through the continuous multiplicative pair `χ₁, χ₂` (the
reducibility input — needed: without it a supersingular `ρ|_{G_p}`
is flat with irreducible inertia charpolys, and the conclusion is
false), the characteristic polynomial of `ρ` at (the image in `G_ℚ`
of) a local inertia element `σ` at `p` is `(X - χ_cyc(σ))(X - 1)`
over `R` — the exact `p`-place analogue of the tame-at-two leaf
`charpoly_eq_of_mem_inertia_two`. Intended proof (Serre, Duke 1987,
§4.1; Raynaud, prolongements de schémas en groupes de type `(p,…,p)`):

* *Reducibility localizes.* By `hchar` the trace function of
  `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` is `χ₁ + χ₂`, a sum of continuous characters, so
  (Brauer–Nesbitt) the semisimplification of `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` restricted to
  the decomposition group at `p` is `χ₁ ⊕ χ₂` — diagonal characters
  valued in `ℚ̄_p`. Hence at every open ideal `I ⊆ R` the reduction
  `(ρ mod I)|_{G_p}` has abelian semisimplification, excluding the
  level-two (fundamental-characters-of-level-2) branch of Raynaud's
  classification at every level.
* *Raynaud at one level.* `hρ.isFlat.cond I` provides a finite flat
  prolongation of `ρ.baseChange (R ⧸ I)` over `ℤ_p`; since `p` is odd
  the absolute ramification index is `e = 1 < p - 1`, so Raynaud
  applies: in the connected-étale sequence of the prolongation the
  étale part carries trivial inertia action, and the connected part is
  of multiplicative type (Cartier duality against the étale part,
  using the cyclotomic determinant of `hρ.det`), with inertia acting
  through `χ_cyc`; so the inertia charpoly of `ρ mod I` at `σ̃` is
  `(X - χ_cyc(σ̃))(X - 1) mod I`.
* *Level passage.* Charpoly coefficients commute with the quotients
  `R → R ⧸ I`; the open ideals contain a cofinal family of powers of
  the maximal ideal (`R` carries the `ℤ_p`-module topology and is
  module-finite local), and `⋂ₙ 𝔪ⁿ = 0` in the Noetherian local
  domain `R`, so the level-wise identity assembles to the stated
  identity over `R`. Alternatively a prover may verify the identity
  after the injective base change along `hRinj ∘ hZinj` into `ℚ̄_p`
  (injective ring maps are injective on polynomial coefficients),
  where it reads `(X - χ₁(σ̃))(X - χ₂(σ̃)) = (X - χ_cyc(σ̃))(X - 1)`. -/

/-- **The flat dichotomy on inertia at `p`** (PROVEN assembly,
DECOMPOSED 2026-07-23 over the single sorried leaf
`charpoly_eq_of_mem_localInertiaGroup_p`): the Raynaud/Fontaine route
stage of `char_add_char_eq_one_add_cyclotomicCharacter`: for a hardly
ramified (in particular flat-at-`p`, cyclotomic-determinant) `ρ` whose
mapped characteristic polynomials split through the pair `χ₁, χ₂`, ONE
of the two characters is trivial on the (image of the) local inertia
at `p` — a disjunction of universally-quantified trivialities, stated
so deliberately to keep pointwise matching out of the statement.
Assembly, two stages:

* *pointwise dichotomy* (`hdich` below): mapping the charpoly identity
  of the leaf along `R → ℚ̄_p` against `hchar` and evaluating at `1`
  (a root of the flat side) gives, at EACH inertia element `σ`,
  `χ₁(σ̃) = 1 ∨ χ₂(σ̃) = 1` — with the matching free to vary with `σ`;
* *swap rigidity*: the matching cannot in fact vary — if neither
  character were identically `1` on inertia, witnesses `σ₁` (where
  `χ₁ ≠ 1`, hence `χ₂ = 1`) and `σ₂` (where `χ₂ ≠ 1`, hence `χ₁ = 1`)
  would give, at the inertia element `σ₁ * σ₂` (inertia is a
  subgroup), `χ₁(σ̃₁σ̃₂) = χ₁(σ̃₁) ≠ 1` and `χ₂(σ̃₁σ̃₂) = χ₂(σ̃₂) ≠ 1`
  by multiplicativity, contradicting the pointwise dichotomy. This is
  the level-independence ("which of `χ₁, χ₂` is the sub-character")
  bookkeeping, done once on characters instead of once per level. -/

`char_add_char_eq_one_add_cyclotomicCharacter`: a continuous
multiplicative unital `χ : G_ℚ → ℚ̄_p` that kills the image of every

also kills every conjugate of every inertia image; the closed normal
subgroup `N` generated by all the inertia images therefore lies in
`{g | χ g = 1}` (a closed subgroup: `ℚ̄_p` is Hausdorff and `χ` is
continuous). The fixed field of `N` is a Galois extension of `ℚ` all

finite place, hence of discriminant `±1`, hence equal to `ℚ` by
Minkowski's discriminant bound (mathlib's
`NumberField.abs_discr_gt_two` gives `2 < |disc|` in degree `> 1`);
infinite Galois correspondence then gives `N = G_ℚ`, so `χ = 1`. -/

/-- **The Eisenstein character dichotomy** (PROVEN assembly, DECOMPOSED
2026-07-23 over three sorried route-stage leaves): if a pair of
continuous multiplicative characters `χ₁, χ₂ : G_ℚ → ℚ̄_p` splits every
mapped characteristic polynomial of a hardly ramified `ρ` (i.e.
`charpoly (ρ g) ↦ (X - χ₁ g)(X - χ₂ g)` for every `g`), then
`{χ₁, χ₂} = {1, χ_cyc}` in the symmetric (summed) form
`χ₁ + χ₂ = 1 + χ_cyc` pointwise. This is the class-field-theoretic
core of the reducible branch, isolated from all linear algebra (the
character extraction is the PROVEN
`exists_char_charpoly_map_eq_of_not_isIrreducible`); the route, one
node per stage:

* comparing `coeff 0` against the cyclotomic-determinant condition of
  `IsHardlyRamified`, `χ₁ · χ₂ = χ_cyc` (mapped) — PROVEN inline
  (`hprod` below);
* at inertia away from `{2, p}`: `ρ` is unramified there, so the
  split characteristic polynomial is `(X - 1)²` and both characters
  die on inertia — PROVEN,
  `char_eq_one_of_mem_localInertiaGroup_of_ne`;
* at inertia at `2`: the tame-at-two condition makes `ρ|_{G_2}`
  triangular with both diagonal entries killed by inertia — PROVEN
  assembly `char_eq_one_of_mem_localInertiaGroup_two` over the sorry
  leaves `cyclotomicCharacter_eq_one_of_mem_inertia_two` (arithmetic:
  `μ_{p^∞}` is unramified at `2`) and `charpoly_eq_of_mem_inertia_two`
  (linear algebra: the tame triangular factorization);
* at `p`: flatness of `ρ` at `p` forces (Raynaud/Fontaine on the
  finite levels) one of `χ₁, χ₂` to die on inertia at `p` — sorry
  leaf `char_eq_one_on_localInertiaGroup_p_or`;
* Minkowski: `ℚ` has no nontrivial extension unramified everywhere,
  so the member of the pair with everywhere-dead inertia is trivial —
  sorry leaf `char_eq_one_of_forall_mem_localInertiaGroup` — and the
  other is exactly `χ_cyc` by the product identity.

The conclusion is stated in the swap-symmetric summed form so that no
choice of matching survives into the statement; the assembly below
symmetrizes through the helper `hswap`, which runs the
Minkowski finish for whichever character the flat dichotomy selects. -/

/-- **Rational traces on the reducible branch** (PROVEN assembly, see
the DECOMPOSED note below): away from
a finite set of places, the TRACE coefficient (`coeff 1`) of the mapped
Frobenius characteristic polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation whose base extension to `ℚ̄_p` is NOT irreducible is a
RATIONAL number. This is the Eisenstein/class-field-theory branch of
the trace shadows — no automorphy enters. Shared
by BOTH trace shadows (a rational number is algebraic, and it lies in
the `ℚ`-span of `{1}`): this is the single reducible-branch node of
the dichotomy decomposition — see the DECOMPOSED notes on
`exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff` and
`exists_finiteDimensional_trace_span`.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over ONE sorried leaf
and proven linear algebra:

1. `exists_char_charpoly_map_eq_of_not_isIrreducible` (PROVEN) — the
   reducible base change carries a pair of continuous multiplicative
   diagonal characters `χ₁, χ₂` splitting every mapped charpoly as
   `(X - χ₁ g)(X - χ₂ g)` (invariant line + block-triangular charpoly
   infrastructure, built here).
2. `char_add_char_eq_one_add_cyclotomicCharacter` (PROVEN assembly,
   further DECOMPOSED 2026-07-23) — the Eisenstein core: for such a
   pair, `χ₁ + χ₂ = 1 + χ_cyc` pointwise, assembled over two proven
   route stages (inertia away from `{2, p}`; inertia at `2` via the
   ModThree inertia bridge) and four sorried leaves
   (`cyclotomicCharacter_eq_one_of_mem_inertia_two`,
   `charpoly_eq_of_mem_inertia_two`,
   `char_eq_one_on_localInertiaGroup_p_or`,
   `char_eq_one_of_forall_mem_localInertiaGroup`; see its docstring
   for the full route).
3. The assembly (below): at the place of a prime `q ≠ p`, the trace
   coefficient of the split quadratic is `-(χ₁ + χ₂)` at the
   arithmetic Frobenius, which by 2. and the PROVEN
   `cyclotomicCharacter_adicArithFrob_natCast` is the rational
   `-(1 + q)`; the exceptional set is the single place over `p`. -/

/-- **The Hecke field on the irreducible branch** (PROVEN assembly,
see the DECOMPOSED note below): away
from a finite set of places, the TRACE coefficients of the mapped
Frobenius characteristic polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation whose base extension to `ℚ̄_p` IS irreducible lie in a
single subfield of `ℚ̄_p` finite over `ℚ`. This is the automorphy core
of the irreducible branch in one node: an irreducible hardly ramified
representation is attached to a weight-2 cuspidal Hecke eigenform
(Wiles–Taylor–Wiles modularity lifting when the residual
representation is irreducible; Skinner–Wiles in the residually
reducible case), its Frobenius traces are the Hecke eigenvalues, and
they generate the Hecke field — a number field; `E` is its image under
the accompanying embedding into `ℚ̄_p`. The irreducibility hypothesis
is genuinely consumed (Taylor–Wiles patching requires it) — the
reducible branch runs through the disjoint Eisenstein route
(`exists_rat_trace_coeff_of_not_isIrreducible`). The `∃ S` is
load-bearing generality: the eventual proof may take `S` to be the
places dividing the level of ANY eigenform attached to `ρ` — no
level-lowering is demanded.

CONSOLIDATION NOTE (2026-07-23): the two irreducible-branch shadows
below (`exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff_of_isIrreducible`,
`exists_linearIndependent_trace_card_le_of_isIrreducible`) were both
atomic automorphy sorries whose eventual proofs would each have been
this whole modularity argument; they are now PROVEN assemblies over
this single node (algebraicity: elements of a finite extension of `ℚ`
are algebraic; batch bound: `d = finrank ℚ E`), so the automorphy
content of the irreducible branch is carried by exactly one sorry.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23, opening the modularity subtree) into a PROVEN
assembly over the modularity interface
(`Fermat/FLT/Modularity/Interface.lean`), where the eigenform now has
an actual carrier on the pin (`Modularity.IsWeightTwoEigenform`, the
Diamond–Shurman 5.8.5 coefficient characterization on the pin's
`CuspForm`):

1. `Modularity.exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_isIrreducible`
   (sorry node) — the modularity input: the Frobenius traces are, away
   from finitely many places, the `ι`-images of the coefficients of a
   normalized weight-2 eigenform `f` of some level `N ≥ 1`, for a
   single embedding `ι : K_f →+* ℚ̄_p` of its Hecke field.
2. `Modularity.heckeField_finiteDimensional` (sorry node) — the Hecke
   field `K_f = ℚ({aₙ(f)})` is a number field (Diamond–Shurman §6.5).
3. The assembly (below, PROVEN): `E` is `ℚ` with the `ι`-images of a
   finite `ℚ`-spanning set of `K_f` adjoined — finite-dimensional
   because each generator is integral over `ℚ` (image of an element of
   a number field under a ring hom commuting with `ℚ`, ring homs out
   of `ℚ` being unique); every trace is `−ι(a_q) ∈ E` by span
   induction (the `ℚ`-scalars fall into `E` through the base field). -/

/-- **Finite-span shadow of the trace field** (PROVEN assembly, see the
DECOMPOSED note below): away from a
finite set of places, the TRACE coefficients of the mapped Frobenius
characteristic polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation
all lie in the `ℚ`-LINEAR SPAN of finitely many elements of `ℚ̄_p`.
Strictly weaker than the Hecke-field statement
`exists_finiteDimensional_trace_field`: nothing is demanded of the
spanning elements — no algebraicity over `ℚ`, no field structure — so
this captures only the finite-generation half of "the traces are the
Hecke eigenvalues of a single eigenform" (they span a
finite-dimensional `ℚ`-space, e.g. the Hecke field itself). Note the
confinement hypotheses `hKfd`/`hK` do NOT give this formally: `K` is
finite over `ℚ_p`, hence INFINITE-dimensional over `ℚ`. The other
orthogonal shadow is `exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff`; their
conjunction recovers the Hecke-field statement by PROVEN linear
algebra — see the DECOMPOSED note on
`exists_finiteDimensional_trace_field`.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over the same
reducible/irreducible dichotomy as `exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff`
(see the DECOMPOSED note there), with the common-spanning-set
packaging additionally moved into proven glue:

1. `exists_rat_trace_coeff_of_not_isIrreducible` (sorry node, SHARED
   with the algebraicity shadow) — on the reducible branch the traces
   are rational, hence lie in the `ℚ`-span of `{1}`.
2. `exists_linearIndependent_trace_card_le_of_isIrreducible` (sorry
   node) — on the irreducible branch, a uniform cardinality bound `d`
   on `ℚ`-linearly independent batches of traces (the weakest batch
   form of "the traces lie in the `[E : ℚ]`-dimensional Hecke
   field").
3. The assembly (below): on the irreducible branch, extract via
   `exists_linearIndepOn_id_extension` a linearly independent subset
   `b` of the trace set whose span contains every trace; `b` is
   finite — otherwise it would contain an independent batch of `d + 1`
   traces (`Set.Infinite.exists_subset_card_eq`), contradicting the
   bound. -/

/-- **Trace-field finiteness core of the eigensystem stratum** (PROVEN
assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note below): away from a finite set of
places, the TRACE coefficient
(`coeff 1`) of the mapped Frobenius characteristic polynomials of a
hardly ramified `p`-adic representation lies in a single subfield of
`ℚ̄_p` finite over `ℚ`. This is the sole surviving automorphy content
of `exists_finiteDimensional_coeff_field` (see the DECOMPOSED note
there): the determinant coefficient is PROVEN rational
(`charFrob_coeff_zero_eq_natCast`) and the coefficients in degrees
`≥ 2` are `1, 0, 0, …`, but the traces are the Hecke eigenvalues of the
cuspidal eigenform underlying `ρ`, and their generating a number field
(the Hecke field) is where automorphy enters. The confinement
hypotheses `hKfd`/`hK` (discharged at the call site by the PROVEN
`exists_finiteDimensional_padic_coeff_field`) record the formal half:
the traces already lie in one finite extension of `ℚ_p`. A finite
extension of `ℚ_p` contains algebraic-over-`ℚ` subfields of infinite
degree (e.g. `ℚ(√ℓ : ℓ a square mod p)` inside `ℚ_p` itself), so
`ℚ`-finiteness is genuinely not formal even given the confinement.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over TWO strictly
weaker leaves — the two orthogonal shadows of "the traces are
the Hecke eigenvalues of one eigenform":

1. `exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff` (as of 2026-07-23 itself a PROVEN
   assembly over the reducible/irreducible dichotomy; see its
   DECOMPOSED note) — each trace is
   algebraic over `ℚ` (no degree bound, no common field);
2. `exists_finiteDimensional_trace_span` (as of 2026-07-23 itself a
   PROVEN assembly over the same dichotomy plus the
   `exists_linearIndependent` span-packaging glue; see its DECOMPOSED
   note) — the traces lie
   in the `ℚ`-linear span of finitely many elements of `ℚ̄_p` (no
   algebraicity, no field structure).

Neither shadow alone suffices (1. allows infinite compositum of small
fields; 2. allows transcendental spanning sets), but their conjunction
is pure linear algebra (the assembly below): intersect the
finite-dimensional span with the `ℚ`-subalgebra of integral elements —
a finite-dimensional space every element of which is algebraic — pick
a finite generating set, and adjoin it to `ℚ`: a finite extension
(finitely many algebraic generators) containing every trace (each
trace is an algebraic member of the span, hence of the intersection,
hence of the span of its generators). -/

/-- **Algebraicity/finiteness core of the eigensystem stratum** (PROVEN
assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note below): away from a finite set of
places, the coefficients of the mapped
Frobenius characteristic polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation all lie in a single subfield of `ℚ̄_p` that is **finite
over `ℚ`**. This is where the automorphy of `ρ` enters: the coefficients
are a priori only integral over `ℤ_p` (hypothesis `hint`, the proven
integrality stratum `charFrob_coeff_isIntegralElem`), and a finite
extension of `ℚ_p` contains algebraic-over-`ℚ` subfields of infinite
degree, so the finite-degree bound is not formal — it is the statement
that the Frobenius traces are the Hecke eigenvalues of a cuspidal
eigenform, which generate a number field (the Hecke field). The
number-field/embedding/polynomial *packaging* of this statement is
proven downstream in `exists_numberField_eigensystem`; this leaf is the
bare mathematical content in minimal vocabulary.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over ONE sorried leaf
and proven strata:

1. `exists_finiteDimensional_padic_coeff_field` (PROVEN) — all
   coefficients lie in a single subfield finite over `ℚ_p` (formal,
   from module-finiteness of `R`, via the PROVEN composite-vs-canonical
   identity `algebraMap_comp_algebraMap_padicInt`).
2. `charFrob_coeff_zero_eq_natCast` (PROVEN) — the determinant
   coefficient at the place of `q ≠ p` is the rational integer
   `q`, by the cyclotomic-determinant condition of `IsHardlyRamified`
   and the cyclotomic-Frobenius evaluation
   `cyclotomicCharacter_adicArithFrob_natCast` (PROVEN 2026-07-23 by
   the general-`p` port of the `3`-adic lemma chain).
3. `exists_finiteDimensional_trace_field` (as of 2026-07-23 itself a
   PROVEN assembly over the two orthogonal sorried shadows
   `exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff` and
   `exists_finiteDimensional_trace_span`; see its DECOMPOSED note) —
   the TRACE coefficient lands in a number field away from finitely
   many places: the sole surviving automorphy content (the Hecke
   field), taking the confinement of stratum 1 as a hypothesis.
4. The assembly (PROVEN, below): coefficients in degrees `≥ 2` are
   `1, 0, 0, …` (the mapped charpoly is monic of degree `2`), the
   degree-`0` coefficient is `q ∈ ℚ ⊆ E` by 2., the degree-`1`
   coefficient lies in `E` by 3. (fed with 1.), and the exceptional
   set is `S ∪ {the places over 2 and p}`. -/

/-- **Eigensystem stratum** (PROVEN assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note
below): the Frobenius characteristic
polynomials of a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation over a
characteristic-zero coefficient ring embedded in `ℚ̄_p` descend, away
from a finite set of places, to a single **number field** `E`.

This is the trace-level shadow of "`ρ` is congruent to a cuspidal Hecke
eigenform": the number field `E` is the Hecke field, `Pv v` is
`X² − a_v X + q_v`, and the finite exceptional set is the level. The
genuine content is the *algebraicity and finiteness* of the trace field:
the Frobenius traces of `ρ` live in the module-finite `ℤ_p`-algebra `R`,
hence in a finite extension of `ℚ_p` — but a finite extension of `ℚ_p`
contains algebraic subfields of infinite degree over `ℚ`, so the
existence of a *number* field `E` capturing all of them (with a single
embedding `ψ` matching the two sides) is not formal; it is where the
automorphy of `ρ` first enters (Hecke eigenvalues are algebraic integers
generating a finite extension).

VOCABULARY NOTE (2026-07-22): the mathlib pin has modular forms
(`CuspForm` etc.) but no Hecke operators, no eigenforms and no attached
Galois representations, so the requested "cuspidal eigenform congruence"
split can only be stated at this trace level; this leaf is its faithful
shadow in the available vocabulary.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22) into a PROVEN assembly over two strata:

1. `charFrob_coeff_isIntegralElem` (PROVEN) — the coefficients are
   integral over `ℤ_[p]` (formal, from module-finiteness of `R`).
2. `exists_finiteDimensional_coeff_field` (sorry node) — the
   coefficients lie, away from finitely many places, in a subfield of
   `ℚ̄_p` finite over `ℚ`. The sole surviving automorphy content at
   this level.
3. The packaging (PROVEN, below): the intermediate field is upgraded to
   an abstract `NumberField` in the required universe via `ULift`, the
   embedding `ψ` is the inclusion, and the polynomials `Pv` are
   rebuilt over the subfield coefficient-by-coefficient
   (`Polynomial.as_sum_support_C_mul_X_pow`), with value `0` at the
   finitely many exceptional places. -/

/-- **Universe/abstraction transport of a concrete realization** (sorry
node, purely formal — no arithmetic content): a hardly ramified
representation `τ₀` over a coefficient ring `A₀` in `Type 0` carrying
the full coefficient-ring package (module-finite local topological

with its framing and its unramified/charpoly-matching behaviour away
from `T`, transports to the SAME package with the coefficient ring in
an arbitrary universe `Type u` — the shape demanded by the abstract
realization telescope. Proof plan: take `A := ULift.{u} A₀` with the
instances transported along `ULift.ringEquiv` (mathlib provides the
ring, topology and `IsTopologicalRing` instances; the module structure
on `W₀` restricts along the equivalence), conjugate `τ₀` by the
identity-on-elements equivalence of endomorphism monoids (the module
topologies correspond along the homeomorphic ring equivalence),
transport `IsHardlyRamified` field by field (`det` via the commuting
triangle of structure maps, unramifiedness via equality of kernels,
flatness via `HasFlatProlongationAt.of_equiv`, tameness by composing
`π` with `ULift.up`), and match Frobenius characteristic polynomials
via invariance of `LinearMap.charpoly` under the scalar-relabeling
equivalence. -/

/-- **Attachment at odd residue characteristics, from a level-2
eigenform** (PROVEN via the dimension-formula route of the modularity
interface: `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0`, so the eigenform hypothesis `hf` is
contradictory — `Modularity.weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`;
DECOMPOSITION PLAN item 3 of
`Fermat/FLT/Modularity/Interface.lean`. The non-vacuous reading,
Diamond–Shurman ch. 8–9, kept for the record): a normalized weight-2 eigenform of level `Γ₀(2)` matching the
eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` yields, at every odd prime `ℓ` and embedding
`φ : E →+* ℚ̄_ℓ`, a HARDLY RAMIFIED representation over the ring of
integers `IntegralClosure ℤ_ℓ L` of a finite extension `L/ℚ_ℓ` whose
Frobenius characteristic polynomials map to `(Pv v).map φ` away from a
uniform finite `T` and the places over `ℓ`. This is Eichler–Shimura/
Deligne (the `λ`-adic representations of the newform of level dividing
2 underlying `f`, with the stabilized-lattice integral model over
`E_λ`'s ring of integers), plus Carayol–Saito local–global
compatibility, plus the level-2 weight-2 analysis giving the hardly
ramified shape — the LEVEL-2 hypothesis is what makes that last clause
sound for every inhabitant of the eigenform carrier (see the soundness
audit in `Fermat/FLT/Modularity/Interface.lean`): at a general level a
wildly-ramified-at-2 eigenform would falsify it. No `ρ` appears: the
statement is purely about the eigenform, which is what makes it an
interface node rather than a restatement of the consuming atom below.
Since `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` (genus of `X₀(2)` is zero), this node is also
dischargeable through the dimension-formula route — DECOMPOSITION PLAN
item 3 of the interface file: no such `f` exists, `qCoeff_one`

/-- **Automorphy core over concrete rings of integers, odd residue
characteristics** (PROVEN assembly as of 2026-07-23 — see the
DECOMPOSED note at the end): the eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` attached
to a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation is realized *integrally*
at every odd prime `ℓ` and embedding `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_ℓ`, with the
coefficient ring CONCRETE: there are a finite extension `L/ℚ_ℓ` inside
`ℚ̄_ℓ` and a hardly ramified representation `τ` over its ring of
integers `IntegralClosure ℤ_ℓ L` (with a framing `r` of its base
extension) which, away from a single finite exceptional set `T` ("the
level", uniform in `(ℓ, φ)`) and the places over `ℓ`, is unramified
with Frobenius characteristic polynomials mapping to `(Pv v).map φ`.
This is Eichler–Shimura/Deligne (the `λ`-adic representations attached
to the weight-2 eigenform underlying the eigensystem) with the lattice
argument giving the integral model — the coefficient field of the
`λ`-adic representation is the finite extension of `ℚ_ℓ` generated by
the Hecke eigenvalues, and stabilizing a lattice puts the
representation over its ring of integers, which is exactly
`IntegralClosure ℤ_ℓ L` — plus local–global compatibility (Carayol,
Saito) for the unramifiedness and charpoly matching, plus the weight-2
level-2 analysis showing the model is hardly ramified. Strictly
shallower than the abstract-coefficient core below (DECOMPOSITION
2026-07-23): the whole instance telescope of the abstract statement is
here replaced by the single geometric datum `(L, FiniteDimensional)` —
the topology, topological-ring, local-ring, `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra,
module-finiteness and embedding fields are all PROVEN instances of the
`ConcreteCoefficientRing` layer above, and the universe quantification
is gone (the transport back to `Type u` is the separate formal leaf
`exists_realization_package_of_concrete`).

The VOCABULARY OBSTRUCTION and SOUNDNESS AUDIT notes on the abstract
core below apply verbatim to this leaf: the integral hardly ramified
model must be produced by the automorphy argument itself (matching
charpolys outside a finite set do not pin the isomorphism class), and
no Hecke-eigenform carrier type is statable on this mathlib pin, so
the leaf keeps the fused Eichler–Shimura + integrality + hardly
ramified shape. RE-AUDIT (2026-07-23, fresh against the actual pin —
see the refreshed VOCABULARY OBSTRUCTION below for the details): the
obstruction stands; the pin's only new Hecke material is
`Mathlib.NumberTheory.HeckeRing.Defs` (abstract double-coset modules,
no ring product, no action on modular forms), and the reference
project's `IsAutomorphicOfLevel` interface is confirmed unvendorable
and non-restating (totally-real-`F` quaternionic shape, ≈22.8k-line
closure with sorried definitions).

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23, opening the modularity subtree — this
supersedes the "no carrier is statable" conclusion of the notes above:
`Fermat/FLT/Modularity/Interface.lean` now provides a sound carrier as
REAL code, the Diamond–Shurman 5.8.5 coefficient characterization
`Modularity.IsWeightTwoEigenform` on the pin's analytic `CuspForm`,
sidestepping the still-absent Hecke operators) into a PROVEN dichotomy
assembly over three strictly shallower sorried nodes:

1. `Modularity.exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_isIrreducible` (sorry
   node, interface file; SHARED with the `λ ∣ 2` atom below) — on the
   irreducible branch the eigensystem arises from a normalized
   weight-2 eigenform of level `Γ₀(2)` (Wiles–Taylor–Wiles/
   Skinner–Wiles + Ribet level lowering; the fused "member existence +
   hardly ramified model" shape of the SOUNDNESS AUDIT is resolved by
   the level-2 pin-down, which forces the hardly ramified shape of the
   attached representations).
2. `exists_ringOfIntegers_realizations_of_weightTwoEigenform` (sorry
   node, above) — Eichler–Shimura/Deligne attachment with integral
   model at odd `ℓ`, for level-2 eigenforms; `ρ`-free.
3. `exists_hardlyRamified_ringOfIntegers_realizations_of_not_isIrreducible`
   (sorry node, above) — the reducible/Eisenstein branch, where no
   cusp form matches the eigensystem (`1 ⊕ χ_cyc` realizes it
   explicitly).

The assembly (below) is the excluded-middle split on irreducibility of
`ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` — the same first move as the trace-shadow dichotomy
(`exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff`). -/

/-- **Automorphy core of the realization stratum, odd residue
characteristics** (DECOMPOSED 2026-07-23 into the concrete automorphy
leaf `exists_hardlyRamified_ringOfIntegers_realizations`, the formal
transport leaf `exists_realization_package_of_concrete` and the
topology leaf `isModuleTopology_integralClosure_padicInt`, glued by the
PROVEN `ConcreteCoefficientRing` instance layer; the assembly below is
proven): the eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` attached
to a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation is realized *integrally*
at every odd prime `ℓ` and embedding `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_ℓ`: there is a
hardly ramified representation `τ` over a module-finite local
`ℤ_ℓ`-algebra `A ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ` (with a framing `r` of its base extension)
which, away from a single finite exceptional set `T` ("the level",
uniform in `(ℓ, φ)`) and the places over `ℓ`, is unramified with
Frobenius characteristic polynomials mapping to `(Pv v).map φ`. This
is Eichler–Shimura/Deligne (the `λ`-adic representations attached to
the weight-2 eigenform underlying the eigensystem) with the lattice
argument giving the integral model, plus local–global compatibility
(Carayol, Saito) for the unramifiedness and charpoly matching, plus
the weight-2 level-2 analysis showing the model is hardly ramified.

VOCABULARY OBSTRUCTION (2026-07-23, recording why the requested
"(a) a weight-2 newform-like eigensystem datum matching `Pv`;
(b) Deligne: the datum yields each `(ℓ, φ)` member" split is NOT
statable on this pin: the pattern established at
`exists_numberField_eigensystem`): mathlib has `ModularForm`/`CuspForm`
but no Hecke operators, no eigenforms, and no Galois representations
attached to them, so a "newform-like datum" has no carrier type. The
reference FLT project states the datum as an `ℤ_p`-algebra hom
`π : HeckeAlgebra D … →ₐ[ℤ_[p]] A` out of a quaternionic Hecke algebra
(`GaloisRep.IsAutomorphicOfLevel`,
`FLT/GaloisRepresentation/Automorphic.lean`), but its entire
`AutomorphicForm/QuaternionAlgebra` tower is absent from both the
mathlib pin and the vendored subset, so that interface cannot be
vendored as a leaf statement here.

RE-AUDIT (2026-07-23, against the actual pin and reference tree,
refreshing the above): (1) the pin has gained exactly one Hecke item,
`Mathlib.NumberTheory.HeckeRing.Defs` — abstract Hecke-triple
double-coset modules ONLY; the convolution product/ring structure of
its "later files" is not in the pin (nothing imports it), and grep
confirms zero hits for Hecke operators on modular forms, newforms,
Atkin–Lehner, eigenforms, or attached Galois representations. (2) The
reference `IsAutomorphicOfLevel` remains unvendorable AND would not
restate these leaves even if vendored: its transitive FLT-internal
closure is 122 files / ≈22.8k lines (quaternionic automorphic forms,
Fujisaki finiteness, adelic Haar measure), it contains sorried
members (including a sorried `IsQuaternionAlgebra (E ⊗[F] D)`
instance inside its own interface layer), and it is stated for
totally real `F` with `2 < [F(ζ_p):F]` — the quaternionic shape the
reference project reaches from `ℚ` only through the (sorried)
`cyclic_base_change`; our leaves are the classical `ℚ`-level
Eichler–Shimura statements, so bridging would ADD Jacquet–Langlands/
base-change content, not remove any. (3) A minimal SHARED interface
for this leaf and `exists_realization_at_two_generated` was examined
and rejected as unsound-or-empty: a "newform datum" carrier has no
definable type (and a sorried opaque `Prop` definition is not a
legitimate leaf — `sorry` may only replace proofs of stated goals),
while a carrier-free shared statement necessarily degenerates to the
literal conjunction of the two atoms — the Brauer–Nesbitt trap below blocks
the only genuine factorization ("bare member matching `Pv`, then
upgrade to a hardly ramified integral model"), and at `λ | 2` the
generated coefficient field is already the exact Eichler–Shimura
output shape with zero slack. The two atoms stay fused and separate.

SOUNDNESS AUDIT (2026-07-23, why the hardly ramified model is fused
with the member existence instead of derived from it): the tempting
intermediate interface "any member `m` matching `Pv` outside `T`
admits a hardly ramified integral model" is FALSE — the same
Brauer–Nesbitt trap as the rejected alternative in the DECOMPOSITION
AUDIT on `exists_family_of_eigensystem`: matching Frobenius charpolys
outside a finite set do not pin the isomorphism class of `m`, and a
rogue non-semisimple `m` ramified at an auxiliary prime matches the
charpolys of a hardly ramified representation without being one. So
the integral model must be produced BY the automorphy leaf, and the
`(ℓ, φ)` member of `exists_realizations_of_eigensystem` is DERIVED
from it by the proven base-change/conjugation glue there — i.e. the
"datum ⇒ member" (Deligne-direction) arrow is the PROVEN half, and
this leaf is the sole surviving automorphy sorry at odd `ℓ`.

TELESCOPE NOTE (2026-07-23): this is the MINIMAL instance telescope for
the integral model — of the coefficient-ring package demanded by
`IsInHardlyRamifiedFamily`, the fields `Module.Free ℤ_[ℓ] A`,
`IsDomain A` and `ContinuousSMul A ℚ̄_ℓ` are OMITTED here because they
are formally derivable from the remaining ones (torsion-free + finite
over the PID `ℤ_[ℓ]` gives freeness; injectivity into the field `ℚ̄_ℓ`
gives the domain; the module topology makes the `ℤ_[ℓ]`-linear
coefficient embedding automatically continuous): the derivations are
the PROVEN assembly `exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations`
below. The fields kept are either statement-relevant
(`IsTopologicalRing`/`IsLocalRing` are binders of `IsHardlyRamified`
itself; the topology carries the continuity of `τ`) or genuinely
pin data (`IsModuleTopology`, the `ℤ_[ℓ]`-structure, the embedding). -/

/-- **Automorphy atom at the even prime, generated coefficients**
(PROVEN assembly as of 2026-07-23 — see the DECOMPOSED note at the
end): given a finite-dimensional coefficient subfield `K ⊆ ℚ̄_₂` which
is EXACTLY the subfield generated over `ℚ_2` by the image of the
eigensystem's number field under `φ₀ : E →+* K` (the hypothesis
`hgen`), the eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` is realized over `K` itself: a
representation `τ : G_ℚ → GL₂(K)`, unramified outside a finite
exceptional `T` (which absorbs the single place of `ℚ` above `2`) with
Frobenius characteristic polynomials `(Pv v).map φ₀` there. This is
EXACTLY the output shape of Eichler–Shimura/Deligne at `λ | 2`
(Diamond–Shurman §9.5–9.6) plus local–global compatibility
(Carayol/Saito): the `λ`-adic representation attached to the weight-2
eigenform underlying the eigensystem is defined over the completion
`E_λ = ℚ_2(φ₀(E))` — which `hgen` makes equal to `K`, with zero
base-change slack left inside the sorry (the spreading to a LARGER
finite-dimensional coefficient field is the PROVEN glue
`exists_realization_at_two_confined` below). No hardly-ramifiedness
demand is made (the notion requires odd residue characteristic) and no
`ℤ_2`-integral model is demanded — contrast the SOUNDNESS AUDIT at
`exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations_core`, where the hardly
ramified clause forces the integral model into the leaf; at `ℓ = 2`
the consumer needs only the bare member, so this atom stays at the
field level. The VOCABULARY OBSTRUCTION note there applies verbatim:
no Hecke-eigenform carrier type is statable on this pin, so the leaf
keeps the fused Eichler–Shimura + local–global shape. RE-AUDIT
(2026-07-23): confirmed against the actual pin — see the refreshed
RE-AUDIT note at `exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations_core`;
item (3) there records why a minimal interface SHARED with the odd-ℓ
atom was examined and rejected (no definable carrier; the carrier-free
version degenerates to the conjunction of the two atoms; this leaf's
generated-coefficient-field shape is already the zero-slack
Eichler–Shimura output).

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23, opening the modularity subtree — superseding
the "no carrier" conclusion above exactly as at the odd-`ℓ` atom: the
interface file provides the Diamond–Shurman 5.8.5 carrier
`Modularity.IsWeightTwoEigenform` as real code) into a PROVEN
dichotomy assembly over three strictly shallower sorried nodes:

1. `Modularity.exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_isIrreducible` (interface
   sorry, SHARED with the odd-`ℓ` atom) — the level-2 eigenform behind
   the eigensystem on the irreducible branch.
2. `Modularity.exists_realization_at_two_of_weightTwoEigenform`
   (interface sorry, `ρ`-free) — Eichler–Shimura/Deligne at `λ ∣ 2`
   for level-2 eigenforms, over exactly the generated coefficient
   field; also dischargeable via `dim S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0`.
3. `exists_realization_at_two_generated_of_not_isIrreducible` (sorry
   node, above) — the reducible/Eisenstein branch (`1 ⊕ χ_cyc,2` over
   `K`).

The assembly (below) is the same excluded-middle split on
irreducibility of `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` as at the odd-`ℓ` atom. -/

/-- **Automorphy stratum at the even prime, confined coefficients**
(PROVEN assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note below): given ANY
finite-dimensional coefficient subfield `K ⊆ ℚ̄_₂` and
an embedding `φ₀ : E →+* K` of the eigensystem's number field, the
eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` is realized over `K` itself: a representation
`τ : G_ℚ → GL₂(K)`, unramified outside a finite exceptional `T` (which
absorbs the single place of `ℚ` above `2`) with Frobenius
characteristic polynomials `(Pv v).map φ₀` there.

DECOMPOSITION AUDIT (2026-07-23): this stratum is
`exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding_core` below with its entire
existential coefficient telescope `(K, FiniteDimensional, φ₀, compat)`
peeled off into hypotheses — the assembly there constructs the
concrete `K₀ = ℚ_2(φ('' spanning set of E))` and corestricts `φ`
through it, all PROVEN.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over the strictly
shallower sorried atom `exists_realization_at_two_generated` above,
which fixes the coefficient field to be EXACTLY the subfield generated
by the image of `E` — the literal Eichler–Shimura output `E_λ`. The
spreading from the generated subfield `Kmin = ℚ_2(φ₀(E)) ≤ K` to `K`
is base-change slack, PROVEN here: `Kmin` is finite-dimensional
because the `IntermediateField.inclusion` into `K` is an injective
`ℚ_2`-linear map, the coefficient extension is framed by
`Basis.baseChange` of the standard basis followed by `Basis.equivFun`,
the scalar action of `Kmin` on `K` is continuous because the inclusion
of subspace topologies is, unramifiedness transports through the
`baseChange` instance of `GaloisRep.IsUnramifiedAt` plus
`isUnramifiedAt_conj`, and the charpoly matching through
`charFrob_baseChange_conj` and `Polynomial.map_map` (the corestriction
of `φ₀` through `Kmin` recombines the coefficient maps
definitionally). -/

/-- **Automorphy core at the even prime, per embedding** (PROVEN
assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note below): the eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)`
is realized at `λ | 2` at a single given
embedding `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_₂` by a representation over a coefficient field
`K` which is a FINITE-DIMENSIONAL subfield of `ℚ̄_₂` through which `φ`
factors — the exact output shape of Eichler–Shimura/Deligne: the
`λ`-adic representation attached to the weight-2 eigenform underlying
the eigensystem is defined over the completion `E_λ = ℚ_2(φ(E))`, a
finite extension of `ℚ_2` (Diamond–Shurman §9.5–9.6; Carayol/Saito
local–global compatibility for the unramifiedness and the charpoly
matching). The exceptional set `T` absorbs the (single!) place of
`ℚ` above `2`, so no "away from `2`" proviso appears; the
finite-dimensionality of `K` over `ℚ_2` is the even-prime counterpart
of the coefficient confinement demanded by the odd-`ℓ` core's
module-finite `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over one strictly
shallower sorried leaf, `exists_realization_at_two_confined` above,
which receives the coefficient pair `(K, φ₀)` as HYPOTHESES: the whole
existential coefficient telescope is constructed here — `K` is `ℚ_2`
with the `φ`-images of a finite `ℚ`-spanning set of the number field
`E` adjoined (finite-dimensional because each generator is integral
over `ℚ_2`: it is a root of the image of its monic `ℚ`-minimal
polynomial, ring homs out of `ℚ` being unique), the image of ALL of
`E` lands in `K` by span induction (the `ℚ`-scalars fall into `K`
through `ℚ ⊆ ℚ_2`), `φ₀` is the corestriction of `φ`, and the
compatibility `(φ₀ x : ℚ̄_₂) = φ x` is definitional. Only the confined
member retains automorphy content. -/

requires odd residue characteristic). Strictly shallower than the

/-- **Residue characteristic 2 member of the realization stratum**
(PROVEN assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note below): the eigensystem
`(E, S, Pv)` is realized at the even
prime as well — for each embedding `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_₂` there is a
2-dimensional `2`-adic representation, unramified away from a finite
exceptional set `T` (uniform in `φ`) and the places over `2`, whose
Frobenius characteristic polynomials there are `(Pv v).map φ`. This is
Eichler–Shimura/Deligne at `λ | 2` plus local–global compatibility;
no hardly-ramifiedness demand is made (the notion requires odd residue
characteristic), so this is the bare member existence — the reason it
is a separate leaf from
`exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations`, whose conclusion
packages the member together with its hardly ramified integral
model.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over one strictly
shallower leaf: `exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding` (itself as of
2026-07-23 a PROVEN assembly over the confined sorried core
`exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding_core`)
realizes the eigensystem at each single embedding `φ` with a
`φ`-dependent exceptional set `T φ`; the assembly (below) removes the
`φ`-dependence by taking the union of the `T φ` over ALL embeddings —
a finite union, because a number field has only finitely many ring
homomorphisms into any field (every `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_₂` is a `ℚ`-algebra
map by `RingHom.equivRatAlgHom`, and `Finite (E →ₐ[ℚ] ℚ̄_₂)` holds by
`Finite.algHom` since `E` is finite-dimensional over `ℚ`). The
uniformity demanded by `GaloisRepFamily.isCompatible` downstream is
thus proven bookkeeping; only the per-embedding realization retains
automorphy content. -/

/-- **Realization stratum of the spreading** (PROVEN assembly, see the
DECOMPOSED note below): the
eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` attached to a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation is realized at every finite place of every residue
characteristic: for each prime `ℓ` and each embedding `φ : E →+* ℚ̄_ℓ`
there is a 2-dimensional `ℓ`-adic representation, unramified at the
places outside a single finite exceptional set `T` (uniform in
`(ℓ, φ)`) not dividing `ℓ`, whose Frobenius characteristic polynomials
there are `(Pv v).map φ` — the *same* `Pv` for all `(ℓ, φ)`: the
cross-`ℓ` charpoly agreement of the family is carried entirely by this
sharing — and which for odd `ℓ` is the framed base extension of a
hardly ramified representation over a module-finite local
`ℤ_ℓ`-algebra.

This is Eichler–Shimura/Deligne (the `λ`-adic representations attached
to the weight-2 eigenform underlying the eigensystem), plus
local–global compatibility (Carayol, Saito) for the unramifiedness and
the charpoly matching, plus the weight-2 level-2 analysis showing the
odd-residue-characteristic members are hardly ramified. The anchoring
of the family AT `(p, ψ)` to `ρ` itself is deliberately NOT part of
this leaf — recovering `ρ` from its charpolys alone is the
Brauer–Nesbitt-unsound direction (see the DECOMPOSITION AUDIT on
`exists_family_of_eigensystem`); the assembly there instead places
`ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` at `(p, ψ)` by hand and uses this leaf everywhere else.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over two sorried
leaves, split along residue characteristic:

1. `exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations` (as of 2026-07-23 a
   PROVEN assembly over the minimal-telescope sorried leaf
   `exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations_core`) — at odd
   `ℓ`, the hardly ramified integral model `τ` over `A ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ` with
   the unramifiedness and charpoly matching stated at the integral
   level (with exceptional set `T₁`). The sole automorphy content at
   odd `ℓ`; see the core leaf's docstring for the vocabulary
   obstruction to a further newform-datum split and the Brauer–Nesbitt
   soundness constraint forcing the model to be produced there.
2. `exists_realizations_at_two` (as of 2026-07-23 a PROVEN assembly
   over the per-embedding leaf
   `exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding`, itself a PROVEN assembly
   over the confined sorried core
   `exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding_core`) — the bare member at
   `ℓ = 2` (with exceptional set `T₂`), where no integral-model demand
   is made.
3. The assembly (PROVEN, below) takes `T := T₁ ∪ T₂` and derives the
   odd-`ℓ` member as `(τ.baseChange ℚ̄_ℓ).conj r` — its
   unramifiedness by the `baseChange` instance of
   `GaloisRep.IsUnramifiedAt` plus `isUnramifiedAt_conj`, its
   charpoly matching by `charFrob_baseChange_conj`, and its
   integral-model clause by `rfl` — i.e. the Deligne-direction
   "datum ⇒ member" arrow is proven glue; at `ℓ = 2` (the only
   non-odd prime) it uses leaf 2's member, the integral-model clause
   holding vacuously. -/

/-- **Spreading stratum** (PROVEN assembly, see the DECOMPOSED note
below): a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation whose Frobenius characteristic polynomials descend to a
number field `E` spreads out into a compatible family of Galois
representations with hardly ramified odd-residue-characteristic members,
containing `ρ` as its member at some embedding of (a possibly larger)
number field into `ℚ̄_p`.

This is the construction of the compatible family attached to the
eigensystem — Eichler–Shimura/Deligne's construction of the `λ`-adic
representations attached to the eigenform underlying the eigensystem,
plus local-global compatibility (Carayol, Saito) and the weight-2,
level-2 analysis showing each odd-residue member is hardly ramified.
The eigensystem hypothesis `heig` is the data the construction consumes;
the conclusion is stated verbatim as the automorphy core of
`mem_isCompatible` below.

DECOMPOSITION AUDIT (2026-07-22, recording a rejected alternative): the
seemingly natural split "(i) `ρ` lies in *some* compatible family; (ii)
any compatible family with one hardly ramified member has hardly
ramified odd members" is UNSOUND at (ii): `GaloisRepFamily.isCompatible`
pins only charpoly data outside a finite set, so a compatible family
containing the hardly ramified member `1 ⊕ χ_p` can place at another
prime a *non-semisimple* extension of `1` by `χ_ℓ` ramified at an
auxiliary prime (a Kummer class of `5`, say) — same Frobenius
charpolys, but ramified outside `{2, ℓ}`, hence not isomorphic to any
hardly ramified representation. The eigensystem/spreading split used
here avoids quantifying over abstract families in the hypotheses.

AUDIT RESTATEMENT #2 (2026-07-23, coordinated with the sole call site
`mem_isCompatible`, following the precedent of the `hZinj` restatement
in the module docstring): the hypothesis
`[IsScalarTower ℤ_[p] R ℚ̄_p]` is ADDED. Without it the conclusion
resists proof at the anchor: the membership clause pins `σ (p, ψ)` to
the base change of `ρ` along the AMBIENT `Algebra R ℚ̄_p`, and the
hardly-ramified clause at `(p, ψ)` then demands an integral model over
a coefficient ring `A` whose embedding `A → ℚ̄_p` IS
`IsScalarTower`-compatible and whose framed base change EQUALS that
member — for a rogue (non-tower) ambient algebra the natural witness
`A := R` is unavailable, and conjugation cannot repair a coefficient
embedding. At the call site the instance is discharged from the
compatibility component of `hembed` (previously discarded).

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-23) into a PROVEN assembly over one sorried leaf:
`exists_realizations_of_eigensystem` provides members at all `(ℓ, φ)`
matching the shared `Pv` (with hardly ramified integral models at odd
`ℓ`); the assembly defines `σ` as those members overridden at `(p, ψ)`
by `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` — whose compatibility clauses come from `heig` via
`charFrob_baseChange_conj` and from `isUnramifiedAt_of_ne`, and whose
hardly ramified integral model is `ρ` over `R` itself (`hZinj` gives
`Module.Free ℤ_[p] R` over the PID `ℤ_[p]`; the tower hypothesis gives
the coefficient compatibility) — and takes the exceptional set
`{place over 2} ∪ S ∪ T`. -/

/-- **B6b**: a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation over a
coefficient ring of characteristic zero (`hZinj`: `ℤ_[p]` embeds — the
audit hypothesis added 2026-07-22, without which the statement is false;
see the module docstring) lives in a compatible family of Galois
representations, all of whose odd-residue-characteristic members are
themselves hardly ramified.

DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22) into a compiling skeleton with one sorried step
(a second sorried step, the false-as-stated injectivity of
`algebraMap ℤ_[p] R`, was the quarantine of the audit defect and is
superseded by the hypothesis `hZinj`):

1. `hembed` — from `hZinj`, the coefficient embedding `R ↪ ℚ̄_p`
   (injective, `ℤ_[p]`-compatible, continuous) is PROVEN.
2. the automorphy core — given the fixed continuous embedding
   `R ↪ ℚ̄_p` (as the `Algebra R ℚ̄_p` instance `ia` in context), the
   hardly ramified `ρ` extends to a compatible family `σ` over a number
   field `E` with hardly ramified odd members, and `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` is the
   member at some `ψ : E →+* ℚ̄_p`. FURTHER DECOMPOSED (2026-07-22)
   into the two strata above: the eigensystem stratum
   (`exists_numberField_eigensystem` — the Frobenius data descend to a
   number field, i.e. the Hecke-field/eigenform-congruence content) and
   the spreading stratum (`exists_family_of_eigensystem` — the
   compatible family attached to the eigensystem, i.e.
   Eichler–Shimura/Deligne plus local-global compatibility). AS OF
   2026-07-23 both strata are PROVEN assemblies, and the Hecke-field
   node `exists_finiteDimensional_coeff_field` is itself a PROVEN
   assembly (see its DECOMPOSED note); the surviving sorried leaves
   (2026-07-23, after the further decompositions recorded at each
   node) are `exists_rat_trace_coeff_of_not_isIrreducible`,
   `exists_isAlgebraic_trace_coeff_of_isIrreducible` and
   `exists_linearIndependent_trace_card_le_of_isIrreducible` (the
   reducible/irreducible dichotomy under the two shadows of the
   Hecke-field finiteness core for the TRACE coefficient),
   `exists_hardlyRamified_integral_realizations_core` (the `λ`-adic
   realizations at odd `ℓ`, minimal telescope) and
   `exists_realization_at_two_of_embedding_core` (the per-embedding
   member at `ℓ = 2`, confined to a finite-dimensional subfield of

NOTE (elaboration): the final repackaging must be `refine` +
a deferred `exact` — an anonymous-constructor `exact ⟨…, ψ, r', hψ⟩`
against the `∃ (_ : Algebra R ℚ̄_p) …` telescope sends `isDefEq` into
a heartbeat timeout. -/
