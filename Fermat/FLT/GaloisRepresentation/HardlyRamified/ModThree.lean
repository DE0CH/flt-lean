/-- **Mod-3 classification** (sorry node): a mod-3 hardly ramified
representation is an extension of the trivial character by the (mod-3
cyclotomic) character: there is a `Γ ℚ`-equivariant surjection onto the
trivial 1-dimensional representation. Input to **B6c**
(`Threeadic.lean`): the 3-adic statement follows by a deformation
argument from this mod-3 statement. (Upstream comment: `Field k` can
probably be relaxed to `(3 : k) = 0`.) -/
