HasseBound.lean — the Hasse bound `|q + 1 − #Wbar(𝔽_q)| ≤ 2√q` for an
elliptic curve over a prime field, together with the *isogeny-degree*
infrastructure it is proven over.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR.  `Fermat/FLT/FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` needs
Hasse's bound (`hasse_bound_natCard_affine_point`) and the Lefschetz
congruence `#Wbar(𝔽_q) ≡ det(1 − F)` on the `N`-torsion
(`natCard_affine_point_eq_det_one_sub_frobeniusTorsionEnd`).  Both are
consequences of ONE classical statement — that the degree of the
endomorphism `[m] − [n]∘F` of `Wbar` over `𝔽̄_q` is the binary quadratic
form `m² − a·m·n + n²·q` — and that statement is what this module
isolates, as `natCard_ker_degreeFormEnd`.  Building it once here rather
than twice inside `MazurTorsion.lean` is deliberate: it is shared
infrastructure between two separately owned leaves, and it is small
enough to elaborate in seconds, which a 33k-line module is not.

THE CUT, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.  An audit of 2026-07-27 recorded in
`MazurTorsion.lean` rejected three cuts of Hasse's bound — degree-form
positivity `∀ m n, 0 ≤ m² − a·m·n + n²q`, an interface-only existential,
and the character-sum/Stepanov route — the first two because they are
*equivalent* to the bound (a binary quadratic form over `ℤ` with leading
coefficient `1` is positive semidefinite exactly when its discriminant is
`≤ 0`), the third because it is a multi-hundred-line polynomial-counting
development.  That audit is correct on its own axis.  The axis it did not
search, and the one taken here, is the ISOGENY axis:

  **give the form a MEANING, so that its positivity becomes free.**

`m² − a·m·n + n²q` is not merely a quadratic form: when `q ∤ m` it is the
CARDINALITY of the kernel of `[m] − [n]∘F`.  A cardinality is a natural
number, so `0 ≤ m² − a·m·n + n²q` is then a `Nat.cast_nonneg` and the
whole bound follows by evaluating at two explicit points.  The leaf that
remains, `natCard_ker_degreeFormEnd`, is therefore NOT equivalent to
Hasse's bound — it is strictly stronger, and it is the classical theorem
(Silverman *AEC* III.6.2 + V.1.1) rather than an inert inequality that no
argument can get a grip on.  That is the trade this module makes, and it
is made with eyes open: the frontier does not shrink, but the surviving
leaf is a NAMED theorem with a textbook proof, it is shared between two
leaves instead of belonging to one, and every step downstream of it is
now machine-checked.

Note the leaf's specialization at `(m, n) = (1, 1)`: it reads
`#ker(1 − F) = 1 − a + q = #Wbar(𝔽_q)`, i.e. the fixed-point identity
`Wbar(𝔽̄_q)^F = Wbar(𝔽_q)`.  That is a consistency check on the sign
convention, and it is also the "cheap first step" that
`natCard_affine_point_eq_det_one_sub_frobeniusTorsionEnd`'s docstring
points its owner at.

/-- **The degree of `[m] − [n]∘F` is `m² − a·m·n + n²q`, counted by its
kernel** (sorry leaf, opened 2026-07-27 as the ONLY remaining input of
Hasse's bound `hasse_bound_natCard_affine_point`): for `q ∤ m` the
endomorphism `[m] − [n]∘F` of `Wbar(𝔽̄_q)` is separable, so its degree is
the cardinality of its kernel, and that degree is the binary quadratic
form `m² − a·m·n + n²q` with `a = q + 1 − #Wbar(𝔽_q)`.

Silverman *AEC*: III.6.2 (`deg` is a positive definite quadratic form on
`End(E)`, via the dual isogeny), III.5.5/V.1.1 (`[m] − [n]∘F` is
separable iff `char ∤ m`), V.1.1 (the evaluation `deg F = q`,
`deg(1 − F) = #E(𝔽_q)`, hence the displayed form).

CLASSICAL DECOMPOSITION, recorded rather than cut, because every piece of
it needs the same missing theory and cutting it would only spread that
theory over three leaves instead of one:

* `deg` exists on `End(E)` and satisfies the parallelogram law
  `deg(φ + ψ) + deg(φ − ψ) = 2 deg φ + 2 deg ψ` (III.6.2).  This is the
  dual-isogeny input and it is the whole difficulty.
* `deg F = q` and `deg(1 − F) = #E(𝔽_q)` (V.1.1); the latter is the
  separability of `1 − F` together with `ker(1 − F) = E(𝔽_q)`.
* `#ker φ = deg φ` for separable `φ` (III.4.10).

THE HYPOTHESIS `q ∤ m` IS EXACTLY SEPARABILITY AND IS LOAD-BEARING.  At
`m = 0` the endomorphism `−[n]∘F` is purely inseparable with trivial
kernel, so the left-hand side is `1` while the right-hand side is `n²q`;
the statement is false without it.

THE STATEMENT IS ALSO TRUE IN THE DEGENERATE CASE `[m] = [n]∘F`, where
both sides vanish: the kernel is then all of `Wbar(𝔽̄_q)`, which is
infinite, so `Nat.card` returns `0`, and `deg` of the zero endomorphism is
`0` as well.  So no nondegeneracy hypothesis is needed.

MACHINERY AUDIT (2026-07-27; the axis searched was a name-level grep over
`Fermat/`, `.lake/packages/mathlib/` and `~/cs/FLT/`, plus a read of this
development's own isogeny API).  Point counting over a finite field IS
present and PROVEN (`natCard_affine_point_eq`, `natCard_affine_point_le`,
`natCard_affine_point_pos`, `natCard_affine_point_le_two_mul` in
`EllipticCurve/TorsionReduction.lean`).  What is absent from all three
trees is the degree of an isogeny.  In particular
`EllipticCurve/Isogeny.lean`'s `degree` is `Nat.card (ker ·)` — the
SEPARABLE degree, which `Isogeny.frobIsog_degree` proves is `1` for
Frobenius — so it cannot serve, and neither can
`WeierstrassCurve.End.exists_charPoly` (`EllipticCurve/IsogenyTrace.lean`),
which reads like this statement but whose `n` is that same separable
degree.  THE CHECK THAT WOULD REFUTE THE "absent" CLAIM: a degree
function on isogenies in any of those trees that is not `Nat.card (ker ·)`,
or a statement of the parallelogram law for it. -/

/-- **Positivity of the degree form** (PROVEN 2026-07-27, and this is the
entire point of the cut): the value `m² − a·m·n + n²q` is a cardinality,
hence nonnegative.  No inequality is proven here — the nonnegativity is
`Int.natCast_nonneg` applied to the leaf above. -/

/-- **Hasse's bound** (PROVEN 2026-07-27 over `degreeForm_nonneg`, i.e.
over the single leaf `natCard_ker_degreeFormEnd`): the Frobenius trace
`a = q + 1 − #Wbar(𝔽_q)` of an elliptic curve over `𝔽_q` satisfies
`a² ≤ 4q`.

THE ARGUMENT, which is the standard discriminant argument arranged so
that only TWO evaluations of the degree form are needed — and arranged so
that both of them respect the separability hypothesis `q ∤ m`, which is
the only subtlety.  Substituting `(m, n) = (a·k + j, 2k)` into the form
gives `j² − D·k²` where `D = a² − 4q` is the discriminant, so `k = 1` and
a small `j` is all that is ever required.  Suppose `D > 0`.

* If `q ∤ a`, take `(m, n) = (a, 2)`: the form is `4q − a² = −D < 0`.
* If `q ∣ a`, then `q ∣ a² − 4q = D`, and `D > 0` forces `D ≥ q ≥ 2`.
  Take `(m, n) = (a + 1, 2)`, which is legitimate because `q ∣ a` and
  `q ≥ 2` give `q ∤ a + 1`: the form is `1 − D ≤ 1 − q < 0`.

Either way the form takes a negative value at an admissible `(m, n)`,
contradicting `degreeForm_nonneg`. -/
