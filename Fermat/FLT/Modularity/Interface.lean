# The modularity interface: weight-2 eigenforms and their eigensystems

This file opens the MODULARITY SUBTREE: it provides the minimal sound
vocabulary needed to state, on this mathlib pin, that the eigensystem
of a hardly ramified `p`-adic Galois representation "comes from a
weight-2 cuspidal Hecke eigenform", together with the sorried automorphy
statements that the three modular-forms-blocked atoms of
`Fermat/FLT/GaloisRepresentation/HardlyRamified/Family.lean` consume:

* `exists_finiteDimensional_trace_field_of_isIrreducible`,
* `exists_hardlyRamified_ringOfIntegers_realizations`,
* `exists_realization_at_two_generated`.

## Design (SOUNDNESS AUDIT, 2026-07-23)

The pin has analytic modular forms (`CuspForm`, congruence subgroups,
`q`-expansions) but NO Hecke operators, eigenforms, or attached Galois
representations. The carrier chosen here is therefore the
**coefficient characterization** of a normalized Hecke eigenform,
Diamond–Shurman *A First Course in Modular Forms* Proposition 5.8.5
(weight `k = 2`, trivial character): a normalized cusp form
`f = Σ aₙ qⁿ ∈ S₂(Γ₀(N))` is an eigenform for the FULL Hecke algebra
(all `Tₙ`, including the bad `U_q`, `q ∣ N`) if and only if

* `a₁ = 1`,
* `a_{mn} = a_m a_n` for coprime `m, n`,
* `a_{q^{r+2}} = a_q a_{q^{r+1}} − q · a_{q^r}` for primes `q ∤ N`,
* `a_{q^{r+1}} = a_q a_{q^r}` for primes `q ∣ N`.

This makes `IsWeightTwoEigenform` a REAL definition on the pin's actual
`CuspForm` type — no opaque carrier, nothing sorried in a definition —
and it is exactly inhabited by the classical normalized eigenforms:

* every newform satisfies it (Diamond–Shurman Theorem 5.8.2 +
  Proposition 5.8.5), so the intended modularity construction can
  inhabit it; and
* conversely every inhabitant IS a normalized full-Hecke eigenform
  (the other direction of 5.8.5), whose good-prime eigensystem arises
  from a newform of level dividing `N` — its conductor (Diamond–Shurman
  Proposition 5.8.4, via Strong Multiplicity One; Galois conjugates of
  newforms are newforms, Theorem 6.5.4), so the sorried attachment statements
  below quantify only over forms for which the classical theory
  genuinely provides attached Galois representations. The FULL set of
  relations (not just the good-prime ones) is deliberate: good-prime
  relations alone do not pin the bad coefficients and would let
  oldform-contaminated non-eigenforms inhabit the carrier, pushing an
  unproven eigensystem-rigidity argument into every attachment sorry.

The two attachment sorries are stated at level `N = 2` exactly: the
classical route (Wiles–Taylor–Wiles / Skinner–Wiles modularity plus
Ribet level lowering; equivalently the "hardly ramified ⇒ automorphic
of level `U₁({2})`" formulation of the FLT blueprint) produces from an
IRREDUCIBLE hardly ramified representation an eigenform of level
`Γ₀(2)` and weight `2` — Serre's conductor-2/weight-2 conditions
(Serre, Duke 1987, §4.1). Restricting the attachment statements to
level 2 is what makes them SOUND for every inhabitant: at level 2 the
attached `λ`-adic representations of the underlying newform (of level
dividing 2) are unramified outside `{2, ℓ}` and flat at odd `ℓ` — the
hardly ramified shape — whereas at a general level a wildly-ramified
inhabitant would falsify the hardly-ramifiedness clause of the odd-`ℓ`
attachment. (Since `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` — the genus of `X₀(2)` is zero —
these level-2 statements are also reachable through the
dimension-formula route; see the DECOMPOSITION PLAN below.)

The REDUCIBLE branch of the three atoms does not run through cusp forms
at all (the eigensystem of a reducible hardly ramified representation
is the Eisenstein system `{1, χ_cyc}`, which no cusp form matches);
it is split off as separate sorried leaves
`*_of_not_isIrreducible` in `Family.lean` next to the atoms.

## DECOMPOSITION PLAN (next rounds of dispatches)

1. **Hecke action** (Diamond–Shurman ch. 5): define the double-coset
   operators `Tₙ` on `S₂(Γ₀(N))` on the pin's `CuspForm` (the abstract
   `Mathlib.NumberTheory.HeckeRing.Defs` double-coset modules carry no
   action on modular forms and no ring product on the pin — audited
   2026-07-23, wrong abstraction to build on); prove the
   `q`-expansion formulas `a_m(Tₙ f) = Σ_{d ∣ (m,n), (d,N)=1} d·a_{mn/d²}(f)`
   and derive Proposition 5.8.5 connecting eigenvectors to
   `IsWeightTwoEigenform`. STARTED (2026-07-24): the prime-index
   weight-2 slash-sum `heckeTransform` (with explicit coset
   representatives `heckeRep`/`heckeRepInf`) is defined below; its
   stability on cusp forms (`exists_cuspForm_heckeTransform`, via the
   `CuspForm.trace` identification) and its coefficient formula
   (`qExpansion_heckeTransform_coeff`, via `hasSum_qExpansion` and
   `qExpansion_coeff_unique`) are PROVEN (2026-07-24); the eigenform
   side of Proposition 5.8.5 at prime index is PROVEN
   (`hecke_eigen_coeff_identity`).
2. **Hecke field finiteness** (`heckeField_finiteDimensional`;
   Diamond–Shurman §6.5): the Hecke algebra preserves the integral
   homology lattice of `X₀(N)` (equivalently: `S₂(Γ₀(N))` has a basis
   of forms with integer coefficients and the eigenvalues are algebraic
   integers of degree ≤ dim), so the coefficients of an eigenform
   generate a number field.
3. **Dimension zero at level 2 — DONE (2026-07-23)**: `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0`
   is proven below (`cuspForm_level_two_coe_eq_zero`, via the norm to
   level 1, the index computation `[SL(2,ℤ) : Γ₀(2)] = 3`, and
   mathlib's level-1 Sturm bound — no `X₀(2)` geometry needed);
   together with `a₁ = 1 ≠ 0` (`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`)
   this DISCHARGES the two level-2 attachment statements
   (`exists_ringOfIntegers_realizations_of_weightTwoEigenform` in
   `Family.lean`, `exists_realization_at_two_of_weightTwoEigenform`
   here) by contradiction — their alternative, non-vacuous route
   (Eichler–Shimura/Deligne plus Carayol/Saito) is not needed.
4. **The residual modularity sorries** `exists_weightTwoEigenform_*`
   below (Wiles–Taylor–Wiles + Skinner–Wiles + Ribet, per the FLT
   blueprint's hardly-ramified formulation) — DECOMPOSED (2026-07-24)
   into five classical pillars (see the section "The classical pillars
   behind the two modularity sorries"): residual reduction, residual
   modularity (weak Serre / Khare–Wintenberger; at `ℓ = 3`
   dischargeable from `ModThree`), modularity lifting (R = T,
   residually irreducible case), the Skinner–Wiles residually
   reducible branch, and level optimization to `Γ₀(2)`
   (Carayol/Ribet). Both former sorries are now proven assemblies
   over those pillars. Pillar 3 (modularity lifting) was further
   decomposed (2026-07-24) into the Taylor–Wiles cut — the Hecke-side
   hardly ramified deformation 3a, the patching statement `R = 𝕋` 3b,
   and the modular-points leaf 3c (see the section "The Taylor–Wiles
   cut behind the modularity-lifting pillar") — and is itself now a
   proven assembly.
5. **Eisenstein branch** (`*_of_not_isIrreducible` in `Family.lean`):
   from the proven reducibility analysis
   (`exists_char_charpoly_map_eq_of_not_isIrreducible`) and the
   character-pair node, the eigensystem degenerates to
   `(X − 1)(X − q)`; realize it by the explicit representation
   `1 ⊕ χ_cyc,ℓ` over `ℤ_ℓ` (odd `ℓ`) resp. over the given `K`
   (`ℓ = 2`), whose hardly-ramifiedness is a direct check (flat:
   `μ_{ℓ^∞} × ℚ_ℓ/ℤ_ℓ`; tame at 2: unramified).

/-! ### `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0`: the dimension-formula discharge route

DECOMPOSITION PLAN item 3, executed (2026-07-23): there is no nonzero
weight-2 cusp form on `Γ₀(2)` (classically: the genus of `X₀(2)` is 0).
The Lean argument avoids the geometry of `X₀(2)` entirely:

* the norm of `f ∈ S₂(Γ₀(2))` over `SL(2, ℤ)` — the product of the
  translates `f ∣[2] r⁻¹` over the cosets `r` of `Γ₀(2)` in `SL(2, ℤ)`
  (mathlib's `ModularForm.norm`) — is a LEVEL-1 modular form of weight
  `2 · [SL(2,ℤ) : Γ₀(2)] = 6`;
* every factor vanishes at `i∞` (a cusp form vanishes at every cusp of
  its arithmetic group), so the norm does too; hence the constant term
  of its `q`-expansion vanishes and the expansion has positive order;
* the level-1 Sturm bound (mathlib's `sturm_bound_levelOne`; for
  weight 6 the bound is `6/12 = 0`) then forces the norm to vanish,
  while a nonzero `f` has nonzero norm (`ModularForm.norm_ne_zero`) —
  contradiction, so `f = 0` as a function;
* finally a normalized eigenform has `a₁ = 1 ≠ 0`, refuting `f = 0`.

The index `[SL(2,ℤ) : Γ₀(2)] = 3` is computed through the mod-2
reduction: `Γ₀(2)` is the preimage of the Borel subgroup of
`SL(2, 𝔽₂)` (order 2 inside a group of order 6, so index 3), and the
reduction map is surjective — witnessed by six explicit integral lifts,
one per element of `SL(2, 𝔽₂)`, checked by `decide`. -/

/-! ### Hecke field finiteness: the single-finite-structure argument

DECOMPOSITION PLAN item 2, executed (2026-07-24), with the former
single geometric leaf `exists_heckeMatrix_eigenvector` DECOMPOSED
(2026-07-24, second round) along the analytic route of DECOMPOSITION
PLAN item 1. `heckeField_finiteDimensional` below is Diamond–Shurman
Theorem 6.5.1: the coefficients of a normalized weight-2 eigenform
generate a number field. The classical proof pivots on ONE finite
object: a Hecke-stable finite rational structure on `S₂(Γ₀(N))`. On
this pin neither Hecke operators on `CuspForm`, nor the modular curve,
nor even finite-dimensionality of `CuspForm (Gamma0GL N) 2` exist
(audited 2026-07-24: only the level-1 space carries a
`FiniteDimensional` instance, from the level-1 dimension formula;
`~/cs/FLT`'s Hecke material is quaternionic-automorphic, not connected
to the pin's analytic cusp forms). The Hecke action is therefore BUILT
here (the weight-2 slash-sum operator `heckeTransform`, over the
explicit coset representatives `heckeRep`/`heckeRepInf` of the
`q`-isogeny matrices), and `exists_heckeMatrix_eigenvector` is now a
PROVEN assembly over three sharply-stated leaves, of which the first
two are PROVEN (2026-07-24) and one remains sorried:

* `exists_cuspForm_heckeTransform` (PROVEN) — `T_q` preserves
  `S₂(Γ₀(N))` (Diamond–Shurman Propositions 5.1.5/5.2.1; here via the
  `CuspForm.trace` of the `α`-translate over the arithmetic conjugate
  group, with the coset space enumerated through the divisibility
  criterion `heckeRep_conj_mem_iff`);
* `qExpansion_heckeTransform_coeff` (PROVEN) — the classical
  coefficient formula
  `a_m(T_q f) = a_{qm}(f) + 1_{q ∤ N} · q · a_{m/q}(f)`
  (Diamond–Shurman Proposition 5.2.2 at weight 2; via
  `hasSum_qExpansion`, the additive character sum, and
  `qExpansion_coeff_unique`);
* `cuspForm_mem_span_rational` — the forms with rational
  `q`-expansions span `S₂(Γ₀(N))` (the rational structure;
  Diamond–Shurman §6.5, Shimura, *Introduction to the Arithmetic
  Theory*, Theorem 3.52). Finite dimensionality of `S₂(Γ₀(N))` and
  the general-level Sturm bound are PROVEN (2026-07-24,
  `exists_cuspForm_sturm_bound`/`cuspForm_finiteDimensional`), so the
  former leaf `exists_rational_qExpansion_basis` is now a proven
  assembly.

Everything else is proven:

* `exists_finiteDimensional_subalgebra_of_matrix_eigenvector` — the
  linear-algebra core: the simultaneous eigenvalues, on one common
  eigenvector, of any family of matrices with RATIONAL entries all lie
  in a single finite-dimensional `ℚ`-subalgebra of `ℂ` (the image of
  the generated matrix algebra under the eigenvalue character). This
  is the "single finite structure" argument: each `a_q` being
  individually algebraic would NOT bound `ℚ({a_q : q prime})`.
* `qCoeff_zero` and `qCoeff_mem_of_forall_prime_mem` — the eigenform
  recursions push membership in any `ℚ`-subalgebra from the prime
  coefficients to ALL coefficients: `a₀ = 0` (cusp vanishing),
  `a₁ = 1`, prime powers by the two Hecke recursions, composites by
  multiplicativity. This is the designated consumer of the four
  `IsWeightTwoEigenform` accessor fields.
* `heckeField_finiteDimensional` — assembly: the coefficient range
  lies in the finite-dimensional subalgebra, hence consists of
  elements integral over `ℚ`, so `heckeField N f` coincides with the
  algebra adjoin and inherits finite-dimensionality.

/-! #### Hecke stability: the trace identification toolkit

`exists_cuspForm_heckeTransform` below is proven by identifying the
Hecke slash-sum with mathlib's `CuspForm.trace`: for
`α = heckeRep q 0 = [1, 0; 0, q]` the translate `f ∣[2] α` is a cusp
form on the conjugate group `α⁻¹ Γ₀(N) α` (`CuspForm.translate` —
holomorphy and cusp vanishing travel along), and its trace back to
`Γ₀(N)` is a bona fide `CuspForm` whose underlying function is
EXACTLY `heckeTransform N q f`, once the coset space
`Γ₀(N) ⧸ (Γ₀(N) ∩ α⁻¹Γ₀(N)α)` is enumerated by the classical Hecke
representatives. The finiteness of that coset space is mathlib's
`Subgroup.IsArithmetic.conj` (conjugation by `GL(2, ℚ)` preserves
arithmeticity). The enumeration itself is driven by one divisibility
criterion, `heckeRep_conj_mem_iff`: for `ρ ∈ Γ₀(N)`, the conjugate
`α ρ α⁻¹` lies in `Γ₀(N)` iff `q ∣ ρ₀₁` — conjugation by `α` divides
the upper-right entry by `q` and multiplies the lower-left by `q`, so
integrality is exactly that divisibility. -/

/-! #### The `q`-expansion of the Hecke slash-sum

Diamond–Shurman Proposition 5.2.2 at weight 2, trivial character,
computed entirely on the pin's `hasSum_qExpansion` /
`qExpansion_coeff_unique` API. The toolkit below evaluates the slash
summands pointwise (`heckeRep_slash_apply` — with mathlib's
normalization the `[1, j; 0, q]` summand is `f((τ+j)/q)/q` and the
`[q, 0; 0, 1]` summand is `q·f(qτ)`), sums the additive character
(`heckeRep_char_sum`: `Σ_{j<q} e^{2πinj/q} = q·1_{q∣n}`), and moves
between the width-`q` and width-1 `q`-parameters
(`qParam_nat_pow`/`qParam_shift`/`qParam_nat_mul`). -/

average the additive character (`heckeRep_char_sum`), reindexing

/-! #### Finite dimensionality of `S₂(Γ₀(N))`: the norm/Sturm route

Added 2026-07-24, cutting the former single geometric leaf
`exists_rational_qExpansion_basis` into its two genuinely different
contents. (i) FINITE DIMENSIONALITY of the weight-2 cusp space at
general level is PROVEN here in full, by upgrading the
level-1/level-2 emptiness technique (`cuspForm_level_two_coe_eq_zero`)
to a quantitative Sturm bound: the norm of `f` down to level 1 factors
as `f · g` where `g` — the product of the translates of `f` over the
NON-identity cosets of `Γ₀(N)` in `SL(2, ℤ)` — is itself
`Γ₀(N)`-slash-invariant (every element of `Γ₀(N)` stabilizes the
identity coset and permutes the rest), holomorphic and bounded at
`i∞`; hence both factors have width-1 `q`-expansions and
`ord(norm) ≥ ord(f)` (`PowerSeries.le_order_mul`), so if the first
`2·[SL(2,ℤ):Γ₀(N)]/12 + 1` coefficients of `f` vanish the norm beats
the level-1 Sturm threshold `weight/12` and dies, hence so does `f`.
A cusp form is therefore determined by finitely many coefficients and
`S₂(Γ₀(N))` embeds into `Fin B → ℂ`. (ii) The RATIONAL STRUCTURE —
a spanning set of forms with rational `q`-expansions, the genuinely
arithmetic-geometric fact (Shimura Thm 3.52) — is isolated as the
single remaining sorried leaf `cuspForm_mem_span_rational` below. -/

/-- **Sturm bound for `S₂(Γ₀(N))`** (PROVEN, 2026-07-24): there is a
finite bound `B` — here `2·[SL(2,ℤ):Γ₀(N)]/12 + 1` — such that a
weight-2 level-`N` cusp form whose `q`-expansion coefficients `a_m`
vanish for all `m < B` is zero. General-level analogue of the
classical Sturm bound, proven by the norm-to-level-1 route of
`cuspForm_level_two_coe_eq_zero` made quantitative through the
factorization `norm f = f · (complementary product)` described in the
section header. -/

finite dimensionality was proven): every weight-2 level-`N` cusp form
is a `ℂ`-linear combination of cusp forms ALL of whose `q`-expansion

*Introduction to the Arithmetic Theory of Automorphic Functions*,
Theorem 3.52 (`S₂(Γ₀(N))` has a basis with integer — a fortiori
rational — coefficients; equivalently Diamond–Shurman §6.5): the
classical proofs go through the `ℤ`-structure of `H₁(X₀(N), ℤ)` under
the Eichler–Shimura isomorphism, or through the `q`-expansion
principle on the modular curve over `ℚ`, neither of which exists on
this pin. Combined with `cuspForm_finiteDimensional`, any maximal

§6.5, the finite input to Theorem 6.5.1; PROVEN assembly, 2026-07-24,
over `exists_cuspForm_heckeTransform` and
`qExpansion_heckeTransform_coeff` — both since PROVEN — and, through
the now-proven assembly `exists_rational_qExpansion_basis`, the one
remaining sorried leaf `cuspForm_mem_span_rational`): for a
normalized weight-2
level-`N` eigenform `f` there are a dimension `n`, a family of
RATIONAL `n × n` matrices `T q`, and a common nonzero complex
eigenvector `v` with `T q ⬝ v = a_q(f)·v` for every prime `q`. The
assembly instantiates the analytic route: `v` is the coordinate
vector of `f` in a rational basis `g` of `S₂(Γ₀(N))` (nonzero since
`a₁(f) = 1`), `T q` is the matrix of the Hecke slash-sum in that
basis — its entries are rational because `T_q` preserves rational
`q`-expansions (`qExpansion_heckeTransform_coeff`) and rational
coordinates against a rational basis are rational
(`exists_ratCast_coords`) — and the eigen-equation is the eigenform
coefficient identity `hecke_eigen_coeff_identity` transported through
the `q`-expansion principle `cuspForm_eq_of_forall_qCoeff_eq`. -/

/-- **Hecke field finiteness** (Diamond–Shurman §6.5, Theorem 6.5.1):
the coefficients of a normalized weight-2 eigenform of level `N ≥ 1`
generate a finite extension of `ℚ` inside `ℂ`. Proven by assembling
the pieces above: the sorried leaf `exists_heckeMatrix_eigenvector`
provides the finite rational structure with the prime coefficients as
simultaneous eigenvalues; the eigenvalue character lands them in one
finite-dimensional `ℚ`-subalgebra `B ⊆ ℂ`
(`exists_finiteDimensional_subalgebra_of_matrix_eigenvector`); the
eigenform recursions push all coefficients into `B`
(`qCoeff_mem_of_forall_prime_mem`); finally every element of `B` is
integral over `ℚ`, so `heckeField N f` — the intermediate field
adjoin — coincides with the algebra adjoin inside `B` and is
finite-dimensional. The level positivity hypothesis keeps the
statement inside the classical theory (`Γ₀(0)` is not a finite-index
subgroup and its "cusp forms" are not the classical space); the
consumers only ever instantiate `N ≥ 1`. -/

/-! ### The classical pillars behind the two modularity sorries

DECOMPOSITION PLAN item 4, executed (2026-07-24). The two automorphy
statements `exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_isIrreducible` and
`exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_isIrreducible` below are PROVEN
assemblies over five stated-and-sorried classical pillars, following
the shape of the classical argument (Wiles, Taylor–Wiles,
Skinner–Wiles, Khare–Wintenberger, Carayol/Ribet):

1. `exists_residual_isHardlyRamified_odd` — residual reduction: the
   reduction of a hardly ramified `p`-adic representation modulo the
   maximal ideal is mod-`p` hardly ramified over the finite residue
   field (general-`p` analogue of
   `IsHardlyRamified.exists_residual_isHardlyRamified`, whose `p = 3`
   instance is already assembled in `Threeadic.lean`).
2. `exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible` — RESIDUAL
   MODULARITY (the Serre-conjecture shadow, weak form: some level
   `N ≥ 1`): an irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ` representation
   arises, trace-by-trace modulo a prime over `ℓ`
   (`MatchesResidualTraces`), from a weight-2 eigenform. As of
   2026-07-24 itself a PROVEN assembly: the `ℓ = 3` instance is
   discharged by contradiction from
   `IsHardlyRamified.mod_three_reducible`, and the sorry moved into
   the `ℓ ≥ 5` leaf
   `exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible_of_five_le`
   (the Khare–Wintenberger content).
3. `exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_matchesResidualTraces` —
   MODULARITY LIFTING (the R = T shadow): a hardly ramified `p`-adic
   lift of an irreducible, residually modular representation is
   modular. DECOMPOSED (2026-07-24) into the Taylor–Wiles cut —
   pillars 3a (Hecke-side deformation), 3b (patching, `R = 𝕋`), 3c
   (modular points); see the dedicated section below — and now itself
   a PROVEN assembly.
4. `exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_residually_reducible` — the
   RESIDUALLY REDUCIBLE branch (the Skinner–Wiles shadow).
5. `exists_weightTwoEigenform_level_two_of_trace_eq` — LEVEL
   OPTIMIZATION to `Γ₀(2)` (the Carayol-conductor/Ribet shadow).
   PROVEN 2026-07-24 as an assembly: the sorried conductor leaf
   `exists_eigenform_level_dvd_two_of_trace_eq` (level lowering to
   some `M ∣ 2`, the genuine Carayol/Ribet content — see its
   docstring for the audit of why the contradiction cannot be pushed
   past that boundary) plus the proven emptiness of both target
   spaces (`weightTwoEigenform_level_one_false` — new, level-1
   norm/Sturm route — and `weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`).

Soundness audit (2026-07-24): since `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` is proven above
(`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`), every statement in this
subtree whose hypotheses include an irreducible hardly ramified
representation is — classically — true both by its cited direct proof
and because the classical chain 2→3/4→5 shows those hypotheses are
unsatisfiable (that unsatisfiability IS the Wiles argument, and it is
where the mathematical depth of the remaining sorries lives). Each
pillar is nevertheless stated in the exact shape of its literature
theorem, so each can be attacked by following its citations without
reference to the collapse.

CIRCULARITY GUARD for future dispatches: pillar 2 (residual
modularity) must NOT be proven through the compatible-family machinery
of `Family.lean` — that machinery CONSUMES the two assemblies below,
so routing pillar 2 through it would close a dependency cycle. The
sound proof routes are the Khare–Wintenberger induction (Invent. Math.
178 (2009)) or the FLT blueprint's potential-modularity chain
(Moret–Bailly + dihedral residual modularity + modularity lifting over
totally real fields, blueprint ch. 4). At `ℓ = 3`, pillar 2 IS
discharged (2026-07-24) by contradiction from
`IsHardlyRamified.mod_three_reducible` (`ModThree.lean`: no hardly
ramified mod-3 representation is irreducible); the `ℓ ≥ 5` instances
carry the real content and live in the leaf
`exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible_of_five_le`.
Pillar 4 at `p = 3` was similarly discharged
(2026-07-24) from the 3-adic classification (`Threeadic.lean`, via
`not_isIrreducible_baseChange_of_isHardlyRamified_three` above): the
pillar is now a PROVEN dichotomy assembly over the `p ≥ 5` leaf
`exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_residually_reducible_of_five_le`,
which carries the Skinner–Wiles content. -/

/-- **Residual reduction** (pillar 1; PROVEN 2026-07-24 by delegation
to `IsHardlyRamified.exists_residual_odd` in
`HardlyRamified/Residual.lean`): the reduction of a hardly ramified
`p`-adic representation modulo the maximal ideal of its coefficient
ring is a mod-`p` hardly ramified representation over the finite
residue field. This is the general-odd-`p` analogue of
`IsHardlyRamified.exists_residual_isHardlyRamified` (`Threeadic.lean`),
whose `p = 3` route the proof follows: the residue field is finite and
of characteristic `p` because `R` is a module-finite local
`ℤ_p`-algebra and a nontrivial domain (`p ∈ 𝔪` by Nakayama, and `𝔪` is
open because a module-finiteness surjection `ℤ_p^n → R` is an open map
for the module topology, so `R ⧸ 𝔪` is a finite quotient of the
compact `R` by an open subgroup), the determinant and outside-`2p`
unramifiedness conditions pass to any base change, and flatness at `p`
resp. tameness at `2` transfer along the open-kernel residue quotient
by the general-place transfer leaves `isFlatAt_baseChange_residue_at`
and `isTameAtTwo_baseChange_residue_res`.  The domain hypothesis on `R`
is not needed (nontriviality, which is what the Nakayama step consumes,
already follows from `IsLocalRing R`), so it is omitted. -/

embedding of its residue field — carries, away from a finite
exceptional set `S`, the Hecke eigenvalue `a_q` to the Frobenius trace
of `ρbar` at `q`. The eigenvalue is an algebraic integer classically,
but `IsWeightTwoEigenform` does not bake integrality in, so the
integrality witness `x` is part of the data. The trace convention
matches the pillar conclusions below: the linear coefficient of the
characteristic polynomial is `−a_q`. This is Serre's "`ρbar` arises

/-- **Residual modularity, `ℓ ≥ 5`** (the general-case leaf of pillar
2 — the Khare–Wintenberger content; DECOMPOSED and PROVEN as an
assembly 2026-07-24): an IRREDUCIBLE hardly ramified mod-`ℓ`
representation with `ℓ ≥ 5` arises from a normalized weight-2
eigenform of some level `N ≥ 1`. This is the level-and-weight-free
("weak") form of Serre's modularity conjecture in the hardly ramified
case (Serre, Duke 1987 — the refined conductor-2 form is recovered
downstream by the level-optimization pillar, not consumed here), a
theorem of Khare–Wintenberger (*Serre's modularity conjecture (I),
(II)*, Invent. Math. 178 (2009)); the FLT blueprint (ch. 4) reaches
the same automorphy through potential modularity.

ROUTE AUDIT (2026-07-24, founder cut — see the module docstring of
`Modularity/KhareWintenberger.lean` for the full both-ways audit):
at the hardly ramified type BOTH literature routes (the KW induction
and the blueprint's potential-modularity chain) terminate in a
contradiction rather than an eigenform — any compatible system
attached to the representation has a `3`-adic member which this
project PROVES reducible with Eisenstein Frobenius traces `1 + q`
(`Threeadic.lean`), and no cusp form matches the Eisenstein system;
transporting those traces back through the family forces the residual
representation to be reducible (Chebotarev + Brauer–Nesbitt). That
nonexistence is exactly the blueprint's ch. 4 headline ("there is no
prime `ℓ ≥ 5` and hardly-ramified irreducible 2-dimensional Galois
representation"), and is what `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` (proven above) demands.
The leaf is accordingly PROVEN by `absurd` from the headline theorem
`not_isIrreducible_of_isHardlyRamified_of_five_le`
(`Modularity/KhareWintenberger.lean`), itself a PROVEN Family-free
assembly over three sorried literature pillars: α — KW minimal
`ℓ`-adic lifting (KW (I) Thm 4.1); β — the compatible system and its
hardly ramified `3`-adic member (KW (I) §5 / BLGGT Brauer trick /
potential modularity, the pillar carrying the genuine remaining
depth); γ — Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt over a finite coefficient field
(mechanical transfer of the proven `ZMod ℓ` twin in `Lift.lean`).
CIRCULARITY GUARD (now enforced structurally): the pillars live in a
module importing neither `Family.lean` nor `Lift.lean` nor this file;
pillar β's docstring forbids discharging it by porting
`Family.lean`'s `mem_isCompatible` proof, which runs through this
interface's consumers. -/

/-- **Residual modularity** (pillar 2; DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 — now a
PROVEN assembly over the `ℓ ≥ 5` leaf above): an IRREDUCIBLE hardly
ramified mod-`ℓ` representation arises from a normalized weight-2
eigenform of some level `N ≥ 1` (the level-and-weight-free "weak" form
of Serre's modularity conjecture in the hardly ramified case; see the
leaf's docstring for the literature). The assembly is the odd-prime
dichotomy `ℓ = 3 ∨ ℓ ≥ 5`:

* at `ℓ = 3` the hypotheses are contradictory —
  `IsHardlyRamified.mod_three_reducible` (`ModThree.lean`, the
  Fontaine/Odlyzko discriminant-bound route) produces a proper nonzero
  `Γ ℚ`-stable submodule of any hardly ramified mod-3 representation,
  refuting `hirr` through the elementary unpacking
  `Slop.OddRep.isIrreducible_iff_forall` — so no Langlands–Tunnell
  input is needed;
* at `ℓ ≥ 5` the statement is the sorried Khare–Wintenberger leaf
  `exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible_of_five_le`.

AUDIT (2026-07-24): the general-`ℓ` form (not just `ℓ = 3`) is what
the consumer chain needs — the sole consumer
`exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_isIrreducible` instantiates
`ℓ := p` with `p` the residue characteristic of the `p`-adic
representation, and the top-level route (`Frey.lean` →
`Reducible.lean` → `Lift.lean`'s `residual_charFrob_eq` →
`Family.lean`'s `mem_isCompatible`) invokes that chain at the Frey
prime `p`, arbitrary `≥ 5`; narrowing this pillar to `ℓ = 3` would
break the assembly, so the split records exactly which instance is
proven and which carries the remaining content. -/

/-! ### The Taylor–Wiles cut behind the modularity-lifting pillar

Pillar 3 (`exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_matchesResidualTraces`
below) DECOMPOSED, 2026-07-24, following the actual architecture of
the Wiles/Taylor–Wiles proof with the flat refinements of
Conrad–Diamond–Taylor and Kisin. The classical argument runs through
ONE auxiliary object — the localized Hecke algebra `𝕋_𝔪` with its
Galois representation — and splits into three statements, each stated
against the project's deformation vocabulary (`GaloisRep`,
`IsHardlyRamified`, `charFrob`, base change — from
`Fermat/FLT/Deformations/RepresentationTheory/` and
`HardlyRamified/Defs.lean`) and the interface's eigenform carrier:

* **3a — the Hecke-side deformation**
  (`exists_hardlyRamified_heckeDeformation_of_matchesResidualTraces`):
  residual modularity converts into a Galois-side package: a
  coefficient ring `T` of the exact shape this file's `R` has
  (module-finite local `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra with its module topology) that is
  moreover `ℤ_ℓ`-FREE — the finite-flatness of the classical `𝕋_𝔪`,
  which also excludes the degenerate torsion instantiations such as
  `T = k` itself — carrying a hardly ramified rank-2 representation
  `ρT` on `Fin 2 → T` that reduces trace-by-trace to `ρbar` through a
  surjection `π : T →+* k`.
* **3b — patching, `R = 𝕋`**
  (`exists_ringHom_charFrob_eq_of_heckeDeformation`): every hardly
  ramified `p`-adic lift `ρ` of `ρbar` factors through the Hecke-side
  deformation on Frobenius traces, via a ring homomorphism
  `Φ : T →+* R`.
* **3c — modular points**
  (`exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_heckeDeformation_point`): every
  `ℚ̄_ℓ`-point of the Hecke-side deformation carries the trace system
  of `ρT` to the coefficient system of a weight-2 eigenform.

The assembly (now pillar 3's proof) is: 3a on the residual data, 3b
against `ρ`, then 3c evaluated at the point
`(algebraMap R ℚ̄_p).comp Φ`.

Soundness of the abstract quantification (audit 2026-07-24): in 3b and
3c the package `(T, ρT, π)` ranges over ALL Hecke-side hardly ramified
deformations, not only the genuine localized Hecke algebra for which
the literature proves the statements. Both remain classically true
under the section audit above (their hypothesis sets include an
irreducible hardly ramified residual representation, which the
classical chain 2→3/4→5 shows to be unsatisfiable), and their intended
discharge instantiates the package produced by 3a, for which 3b is
verbatim Taylor–Wiles(–Kisin) `R = 𝕋` and 3c is the Deligne–Serre
eigensystem decomposition of `𝕋_𝔪 ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ`.

CIRCULARITY GUARD (inherited from pillar 3, mandatory): none of 3a–3c
may be proven through `Family.lean`'s compatible-family machinery —
`Family.lean` imports this file and consumes the assemblies below, so
any such route is circular (and is structurally an import cycle). -/

/-! #### The Carayol cut behind pillar 3a

Pillar 3a DECOMPOSED, 2026-07-24, following the actual shape of
Carayol's construction (*Formes modulaires et représentations
galoisiennes à valeurs dans un anneau local complet*, Contemp. Math.
165 (1994)): the Hecke-side deformation is glued from the `λ`-adic
representations attached to the eigenform components of the localized
Hecke algebra. The cut isolated the geometric content in two leaves
and PROVED the Chebotarev-density step between them; the
Hecke-package leaf 3a-i is since PROVEN by its route audit (the same
odd-prime dichotomy that discharges pillar 2 — see its docstring),
leaving the Carayol descent 3a-ii as the one open leaf:

* **3a-i — the Hecke algebra with its realizations**
  (`exists_heckeAlgebra_realizations_of_matchesResidualTraces`,
  PROVEN 2026-07-24 by the route audit recorded on the theorem —
  no non-vacuous discharge exists, and the hypothesis class is
  refuted by the `ℓ = 3` / `ℓ ≥ 5` dichotomy over the
  separately-owned nonexistence nodes already carrying pillar 2):
  residual modularity produces the coefficient package
  `(T, t, π)` — the localized anemic weight-2 Hecke algebra with its
  prime-indexed Hecke elements `t q` and residual reduction `π` —
  together with finitely many jointly injective coordinates into
  local coefficient rings, each carrying a hardly ramified eigenform
  representation whose Frobenius traces interpolate the `t q`
  (the bundled `HardlyRamifiedRealization`).
* **PROVEN — the Chebotarev trace gluing**
  (`forall_exists_toFun_eq_charpoly_coeff_one`): at EVERY group
  element — not just at Frobenii — the joint trace tuple of the
  realizations lies in the image of `T`. Proof: the image of the
  compact `T` under the continuous joint coordinate map is closed;
  the joint trace function is continuous (the trace is a linear
  functional on the endomorphism algebra, hence continuous in the
  module topology — `charpoly.coeff 1` itself has no continuity
  API, whence the proven bridge
  `charpoly_coeff_one_eq_neg_trace`); the Frobenius conjugacy
  classes off the exceptional set land in the image by the
  interpolation hypothesis and conjugation-invariance of
  characteristic polynomials (`charpoly_conj_mul_inv`); and those
  classes are dense (`dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`,
  `Chebotarev.lean`). This is the exact glue Carayol's construction
  needs: it converts Frobenius-indexed trace data into a trace
  function on the whole group with values in `T`.
* **3a-ii — the Carayol descent**
  (`exists_hardlyRamified_galoisRep_of_realizations`, DECOMPOSED
  2026-07-24 — now a PROVEN assembly over the Nyssen–Rouquier cut
  below): the glued trace system over the local ring `T`, reducing
  through `π` to the traces of the residually IRREDUCIBLE `ρbar`, is
  the trace system of an actual hardly ramified representation on
  `Fin 2 → T`.

The assembly (now pillar 3a's proof) is 3a-i, then the proven gluing,
then 3a-ii, then the sign bookkeeping `π (t q) = −tr ρbar(Frob q)`.

Soundness audit (2026-07-24, inherited from the section docstring):
as with 3b/3c, the leaves quantify over data more general than the
honest localized Hecke algebra; both remain classically true because
their hypothesis sets include an irreducible hardly ramified residual
representation, which the classical chain 2→3/4→5 shows to be
unsatisfiable, and their non-vacuous intended discharge is the
classical construction recorded in their docstrings. -/

/-- **A hardly ramified realization of a Hecke-side coefficient ring**
`T`: one "eigenform component" of the would-be Hecke algebra — a local
coefficient ring `O` (intended: the integers of a finite extension of
`ℚ_ℓ`, the completion of the Hecke field of an eigenform component of
`T ⊗ ℚ_ℓ` at a place over `ℓ`), a `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra coordinate
`toFun : T →ₐ O`, and a hardly ramified representation over `O` (the
`λ`-adic representation attached to the eigenform by Eichler–Shimura,
integrally realized on a stable lattice — unique up to homothety when
the residual representation is irreducible). The instance fields
mirror the coefficient package of `Lift.lean`'s `HardlyRamifiedLift`
(which lives DOWNSTREAM of this file and cannot be imported), plus
`ℤ_ℓ`-freeness and Hausdorffness — both automatic for the intended `O`
and consumed by the compactness/closedness step of the Chebotarev
gluing below. -/

/-- **The Hecke algebra with its hardly ramified realizations**
(pillar 3a-i; PROVEN 2026-07-24 by the odd-prime dichotomy — see the
ROUTE AUDIT below): residual modularity of the irreducible hardly
ramified `ρbar` at some level `N₀` produces the Hecke-side coefficient
package with its eigenform realizations. Classical construction
(recorded as the would-be non-vacuous discharge; the ROUTE AUDIT shows
it terminates in the PROVEN emptiness of the optimized level rather
than in a package): (1) optimize the
level to the Serre type of `ρbar` (Ribet, Invent. Math. 100 (1990);
Serre, Duke 1987 §4.1 — for the hardly ramified type the odd part of
the conductor is trivial and the weight is 2); (2) let `T₀` be the
ANEMIC weight-2 Hecke algebra `ℤ[T_q : q ∤ 2ℓN] ⊗ ℤ_ℓ` — good primes
only, so the algebra is reduced (the good `T_q` act semisimply on
`S₂`) and its traces are exactly what Carayol's gluing controls —
localized at the maximal ideal cut out by `ρbar`'s eigensystem
through the `φ` of `MatchesResidualTraces` (non-Eisenstein because
`ρbar` is irreducible): `T₀` is local, module-finite and torsion-free
over `ℤ_ℓ` (it acts faithfully on the `𝔪`-localized integral homology
of the modular curve `X₀(N)`), hence FREE over the PID `ℤ_ℓ`, and
compact in its module topology (quotient of `ℤ_ℓ^m`); (3) enlarge
coefficients unramifiedly, `T := (T₀ ⊗_{W(k₀)} W(k))_𝔪'`, so that the
residual reduction `π` is surjective onto the GIVEN `k` (not merely
onto the subfield its eigenvalues generate); (4) `t q` := the image
of the Hecke operator `T_q` (junk at the finitely many excluded
primes — absorbed into `S_T`), with `π (t q) = tr ρbar(Frob q)
= −charFrob.coeff 1` by the matching hypothesis; (5) `T` reduced and
finite flat makes `T ⊗ ℚ_ℓ` a finite product of finite extensions
`E_i/ℚ_ℓ`; the coordinates `λ_i : T →ₐ O_{E_i}` (integrality of `T`)
are JOINTLY INJECTIVE by torsion-freeness; (6) each factor is the
eigensystem of a Galois-conjugate newform component `f_i`, whose
attached `λ`-adic representation (Eichler–Shimura/Deligne, weight 2)
realizes it integrally on a residually irreducible — hence unique up
to homothety — lattice over `O_{E_i}`, hardly ramified by: determinant
cyclotomic (weight 2, trivial nebentypus), unramified outside `2ℓ`
(optimized level), flat at `ℓ` (weight 2, level prime to `ℓ`:
Fontaine–Laffaille; Conrad–Diamond–Taylor), tame at 2 with unramified
square-trivial rank-1 quotient (conductor exponent `≤ 1` at 2:
Carayol–Saito local–global compatibility); the Eichler–Shimura
congruence gives the interpolation `tr ρ_i(Frob q) = λ_i(t q)`.

ROUTE AUDIT (2026-07-24, following the precedent of pillar 2's `ℓ ≥ 5`
leaf): NO non-vacuous discharge of this statement is possible in this
repository. With `n = 0` realizations the joint-injectivity clause
degenerates to `∀ x y : T, x = y`, contradicting the nontriviality in
`IsLocalRing T`; and a realization (`n ≥ 1`) is classically the
attached representation of a weight-2 newform whose level equals its
conductor (Carayol), which hardly-ramifiedness forces to divide 2
(flat at `ℓ` at weight 2 makes the level prime to `ℓ`; tame at 2 with
conductor exponent `≤ 1` caps the even part) — while
`S₂(Γ₀(1)) = S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` are PROVEN above
(`weightTwoEigenform_level_one_false`,
`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`). The classical construction
recorded above thus terminates in the emptiness of the optimized
level — a refutation of the hypothesis class, never a package —
exactly as both literature routes in pillar 2's route audit. The
proof is accordingly the SAME odd-prime dichotomy that discharges
pillar 2 (`exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible`),
over the same two separately-owned nonexistence nodes, adding no new
frontier: at `ℓ = 3`, `IsHardlyRamified.mod_three_reducible`
(`ModThree.lean`, the Fontaine/Odlyzko discriminant-bound route)
produces a `Γ ℚ`-stable proper nonzero submodule refuting `hirr`
through `Slop.OddRep.isIrreducible_iff_forall`; at `ℓ ≥ 5`, `hirr` is

/-! #### The Nyssen–Rouquier cut behind pillar 3a-ii

Pillar 3a-ii DECOMPOSED, 2026-07-24, isolating the mathematical core
of Carayol's Théorème 2 (equivalently the pseudocharacter theory of
Nyssen and Rouquier) — a residually irreducible trace system over the
local ring `T` is the trace system of an actual representation on
`Fin 2 → T` — from the descent of hardly-ramifiedness along Théorème 1
uniqueness, which splits into its three nontrivial clauses:

* **the compatibility carrier** (`IsRealizationCompatible`,
  definition): the descended representation is tied to the
  realizations by trace AND determinant through every coordinate
  `toFun i` at EVERY group element — exactly the interface Théorème 1
  consumes.
* **3a-ii-α — the construction**
  (`exists_galoisRep_isRealizationCompatible`, sorry node): the
  Carayol/Nyssen–Rouquier core, producing the compatible `ρT`.
* **3a-ii-β — unramifiedness descent**
  (`isUnramifiedAt_of_isRealizationCompatible`, sorry node).
* **3a-ii-γ — flatness descent**
  (`isFlatAt_of_isRealizationCompatible`, sorry node).
* **3a-ii-δ — tameness-at-2 descent**
  (`isTameAtTwo_of_isRealizationCompatible`, sorry node).
* **PROVEN — the assembly** (now pillar 3a-ii's proof body): the rank
  computation, the cyclotomic-determinant clause of
  hardly-ramifiedness (joint injectivity, the realizations'
  determinant clauses, and `AlgHom.commutes` for the `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra
  normalization), and the Frobenius trace clause (joint injectivity
  and the interpolation hypothesis `htr`).

Soundness audit (2026-07-24, inherited from the section docstring):
every leaf keeps the full hypothesis package of 3a-ii — in particular
the irreducible hardly ramified residual `ρbar` — so each remains
classically true (the hypothesis set is classically unsatisfiable),
and the non-vacuous intended discharge is the classical construction
recorded in its docstring. CIRCULARITY GUARD: as everywhere in pillar
3, none of the leaves may be proven through `Family.lean`. -/

/-- **The compatibility carrier of the Nyssen–Rouquier cut**: `ρT` is
*realization-compatible* if through every coordinate `toFun i` its
characteristic-polynomial linear coefficient (`= −trace`,
`charpoly_coeff_one_eq_neg_trace`) and its determinant agree with
those of the `i`-th realization at EVERY element of `Γ ℚ`. This is
the exact interface between the construction leaf 3a-ii-α and the
three descent leaves: by Carayol's Théorème 1 (uniqueness over a
local ring with residually absolutely irreducible reduction), it pins
the `toFun i`-base-change of `ρT` up to conjugacy to `(real i).ρ`,
along which hardly-ramifiedness descends clause by clause. -/

sorry node — Carayol, *Formes modulaires et représentations
galoisiennes à valeurs dans un anneau local complet*, Contemp. Math.
165 (1994), Théorème 2; Nyssen, Math. Ann. 306 (1996) 257–283;
Rouquier, J. Algebra 180 (1996) 571–586): the glued trace system over
`T` is the trace system of an actual representation on `Fin 2 → T`,
compatible with every realization. Intended construction:
(1) *the pseudocharacter*: `hglue` + `hinj` define `τ : Γ ℚ → T` with
`toFun i (τ g) = (charpoly (ρᵢ g)).coeff 1 = −tr ρᵢ(g)` for all `i`;
set `tr := −τ` and `d g := (tr(g)² − tr(g²))/2` (`2` is a unit: `T`
is a `ℤ_ℓ`-algebra, `ℓ` odd); all dimension-2 pseudocharacter
identities and continuity hold because they hold coordinatewise in
the honest traces of the `ρᵢ` and the joint coordinate map is
injective (`hinj`) — continuity via the closed embedding of the
compact `T` (module-finite free over `ℤ_ℓ` in the module topology)
into `∏ᵢ Oᵢ`;
(2) *residual absolute irreducibility*: `π ∘ tr` agrees with
`tr ρbar` at the Frobenii off `S_T` (`hred`, `htr`), hence everywhere
(Chebotarev density, continuity into the discrete `k`); `ρbar` is
irreducible and odd (its determinant is cyclotomic, evaluating to
`−1` at complex conjugation), hence absolutely irreducible for the
odd `ℓ` (the `OddRep` argument);
(3) *matrix coefficients over the local ring*: complex conjugation
`c` has `tr c = 0` and `d c = −1`, so its residual image has the
distinct eigenvalues `±1` (`ℓ` odd) and the trace system splits along
the lifted idempotent pair into diagonal corner functions
`a, d : Γ ℚ → T` and off-diagonal corner PRODUCTS
`x(g)·y(h) ∈ T` (pseudocharacter polarizations); residual absolute
irreducibility produces `g₀, h₀` with `x(g₀)·y(h₀) ∈ Tˣ` (`T` local —
otherwise the residual trace system would be a sum of two
characters), which normalizes the off-diagonal corners into honest
functions; the pseudocharacter identities are then exactly the `2×2`
multiplication law, yielding a continuous representation
`ρT : Γ ℚ → GL₂(T)` on `Fin 2 → T` with trace `tr` and
determinant `d`;
(4) *compatibility*: `toFun i ∘ tr = tr ρᵢ` by construction, and
`toFun i ∘ d = det ρᵢ` since a rank-2 determinant is determined by
the traces at `g` and `g²` when `2` is a unit — which is
`IsRealizationCompatible` in the `charpoly.coeff 1 = −tr` spelling.
Sound as stated by the section audit (vacuously; the non-vacuous
intended discharge is at the honest Hecke package of 3a-i).

/-- **Unramifiedness descent** (pillar 3a-ii-β; sorry node — Carayol
Théorème 1): the descended representation is unramified outside `2ℓ`.
Intended proof: fix `p ∉ {2, ℓ}` and `σ` in the inertia at `p`. Each
realization `ρᵢ` is unramified at `p` (its `isHardlyRamified` field),
so `ρᵢ(σ) = 1`. By Théorème 1 — over the local `Oᵢ`, a representation
with residually absolutely irreducible reduction is determined up to
conjugacy by its trace, and the residual reduction of `ρᵢ` is
identified with the odd irreducible (hence absolutely irreducible,
`OddRep`) `ρbar` through `hred`/`htr` and Brauer–Nesbitt — the
`toFun i`-base-change of `ρT` is conjugate to `ρᵢ`; hence for every
`i` the base change of `ρT(σ)` is `1`, i.e. `toFun i` maps every
standard-basis matrix entry of `ρT(σ)` to the corresponding entry of
`1`, and joint injectivity `hinj` gives `ρT(σ) = 1` entrywise. Sound
as stated by the section audit. CIRCULARITY GUARD: must not be proven

/-- **Flatness descent** (pillar 3a-ii-γ; sorry node — Raynaud's
closure properties of finite flat prolongations): the descended
representation is flat at `ℓ`. Intended proof: for an open ideal
`I ≤ T`, the finite `Γ ℚ_ℓ`-module `(Fin 2 → T)/I` embeds
`Γ`-equivariantly into a finite product `∏ᵢ (Fin 2 → Oᵢ)/Jᵢ` of
quotients of the realization lattices: the `toFun i`-base-changes of
`ρT` are conjugate to the `ρᵢ` (Théorème 1, as in 3a-ii-β), the joint
coordinate map is injective (`hinj`), and by linear compactness `I`
contains the preimage of a suitable open `∏ᵢ Jᵢ`. Each
`(Fin 2 → Oᵢ)/Jᵢ` has a finite flat prolongation (the `isFlat` field
of the realizations), finite flat group schemes over `ℤ_ℓ` are closed
under finite products, and — `ℓ` odd, absolute ramification `e = 1 <
ℓ − 1` — Raynaud's theorem provides the finite flat prolongation of
the generic-fiber subobject (schematic closure) realizing

Carayol–Saito local–global compatibility, descended along Théorème 1):
the descended representation is upper-triangular at `2` with an
unramified square-trivial rank-1 quotient. Intended proof: each
realization carries a `G₂`-stable surjection `Fin 2 → Oᵢ → Oᵢ` with
unramified square-trivial quotient character `δᵢ` (its `isTameAtTwo`
field). When `ρbar|_{G₂}` has a UNIQUE unramified square-trivial
quotient character, the kernels of these surjections, pulled back
through the Théorème 1 conjugacies (as in 3a-ii-β), are the
`toFun i`-base-changes of one common `T`-line — the kernel of a
surjection `Fin 2 → T → T` glued by joint injectivity and linear
compactness of `T`; in the degenerate split case (`ρbar|_{G₂}` a sum
of two unramified square-trivial characters) choose the lines
compatibly across the realizations through their congruences before
gluing. The quotient action `δ` then satisfies `toFun i ∘ δ = δᵢ` for

/-- **The Hecke-side deformation** (pillar 3a; DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 —
now a PROVEN assembly over the Carayol cut above: the geometric leaf
3a-i produces the Hecke algebra with its eigenform realizations, the
PROVEN Chebotarev gluing turns their Frobenius-indexed traces into a
`T`-valued trace system on the whole group, the descent leaf 3a-ii
produces the hardly ramified `ρT`, and the residual clause is the sign
bookkeeping `π (−t q) = charFrob.coeff 1`): an irreducible hardly
ramified mod-`ℓ` representation that arises from a weight-2 eigenform
of some level `N₀ ≥ 1` (in the `MatchesResidualTraces` sense) arises
from a whole Hecke-side hardly ramified DEFORMATION: a local
`ℤ_ℓ`-algebra `T`, module-finite and FREE over `ℤ_ℓ` (the classical
`𝕋_𝔪` is finite flat over `ℤ_ℓ`, acting faithfully on the
`𝔪`-localized integral homology of the modular curve; the freeness
component is what excludes degenerate torsion packages such as
`T = k`), with its module topology, together with a hardly ramified
representation `ρT` on `Fin 2 → T` reducing trace-by-trace to `ρbar`
through a surjective `π : T →+* k` away from a finite exceptional set.
Classical construction: optimize the level to the Serre type (Ribet,
*On modular representations of `Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)` arising from modular
forms*, Invent. Math. 100 (1990); Serre, Duke 1987 §4.1 — for the
hardly ramified type the odd part of the Serre conductor is trivial
and the weight is 2), let `T = 𝕋_𝔪` be the weight-2 Hecke algebra at
the optimized level localized at the maximal ideal cut out by `ρbar`'s
eigensystem through `f₀` (non-Eisenstein because `ρbar` is
irreducible), and let `ρT` be Carayol's `𝕋_𝔪`-valued representation
(Carayol, *Formes modulaires et représentations galoisiennes à valeurs
dans un anneau local complet*, Contemp. Math. 165 (1994) — glued from
the eigenform representations by Chebotarev density plus residual
irreducibility). Hardly-ramifiedness of `ρT`: determinant cyclotomic
(weight 2, trivial nebentypus), unramified outside `2ℓ`, flat at `ℓ`
(weight 2 and level prime to `ℓ`: Fontaine–Laffaille theory;
Conrad–Diamond–Taylor for the general flat bookkeeping), tame at `2`
with unramified square-trivial rank-1 quotient (conductor exponent
`≤ 1` at `2`: Carayol–Saito local–global compatibility).

/-- **Patching: `R = 𝕋`** (pillar 3b; DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 — now a
PROVEN assembly over the deformation-theoretic pillars of
`Modularity/Patching.lean`; the Taylor–Wiles theorem specialized to
the hardly ramified deformation problem): a
hardly ramified `p`-adic representation `ρ` over `R` whose residual
representation `ρ.baseChange kk` is irreducible and underlies a
Hecke-side hardly ramified deformation `(T, ρT, π)` factors through
that deformation on Frobenius traces: some ring homomorphism
`Φ : T →+* R` carries the trace system of `ρT` to that of `ρ` away
from a finite exceptional set (as everywhere in this file, the
`charFrob` linear coefficient — the trace up to sign — is the carried
quantity). Classically: the hardly ramified conditions are exactly a
deformation problem for `ρ.baseChange kk` over complete Noetherian
local `ℤ_p`-algebras with residue field `kk` — determinant cyclotomic,
unramified outside `2p`, flat at `p` (the `GaloisRep.IsFlatAt`
flat-prolongation condition of `Deformations/RepresentationTheory/`),
tame square-trivial at `2` — representable by a universal ring
`R_univ` (Mazur; residual irreducibility removes the framing); the
trace-generation property of the Hecke deformation gives a surjection
`R_univ ↠ T` (Carayol), which Taylor–Wiles patching — with the flat
condition at `p` handled after Conrad–Diamond–Taylor and Kisin
(*Moduli of finite flat group schemes, and modularity*, Ann. of Math.
170 (2009)) — proves to be an isomorphism; and `ρ` itself, a typed
deformation over the complete Noetherian local ring `R` (module-finite
local `ℤ_p`-algebra with residue field `kk` through `hsurj`), is
classified by a map `R_univ → R`, whose composite with `T ≅ R_univ`
is `Φ`. Literature: Wiles, *Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last
Theorem*, Ann. of Math. 141 (1995), ch. 2–3; Taylor–Wiles,
*Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras*, ibid.; Diamond,
*The Taylor–Wiles construction and multiplicity one*, Invent. Math.
128 (1997). Abstract-quantification caveat: see the section docstring
— for a packet smaller than the full `𝕋_𝔪` the factorization is not
the literature statement; the leaf remains sound by the section audit,
and its intended discharge is at the full packet of pillar 3a.
CIRCULARITY GUARD: must not be proven through `Family.lean`.

The proof is exactly the recorded classical route, assembled over the
three sorried pillars of `Modularity/Patching.lean` (a module upstream
of this file — the guard is structural: `Lift.lean`'s parallel
deformation vocabulary sits BELOW `Family.lean` and is
import-unreachable): Mazur representability
(`exists_weaklyUniversal_hardlyRamifiedDeformation`) yields a weakly
universal package `(Runiv, ρuniv, πuniv)` with factorization clauses
at the two needed module universes; the `T`-side clause classifies the
Hecke packet (a `HardlyRamifiedFiniteDeformation` literal) by
`ψT : Runiv →+* T`, which Carayol surjectivity
(`surjective_ringHom_of_charFrob_eq`) and Taylor–Wiles injectivity
(`injective_ringHom_of_isWeaklyUniversal`) upgrade to a ring
isomorphism; the `V`-side clause classifies `ρ` itself by
`ψR : Runiv →+* R` — its reduction datum is the PROVEN
`charFrob`/base-change bridge (`charFrob_baseChange`), with empty
exceptional set; and `Φ := ψR ∘ ψT⁻¹`.  (The domain hypothesis on `R`
plays no role in the argument — the deformation vocabulary needs only
the module-finite local `ℤ_p`-algebra structure — so it is omitted.) -/

/-- **Points of the Hecke package are embedded eigensystems** (the
Deligne–Serre point leaf of the Carayol cut; sorry node): a
ring-homomorphism point `μ : T →+* ℚ̄_ℓ` of a Hecke-side coefficient
package — `T` with its prime-indexed Hecke elements `t q`, residual
reduction `π` matching the eigensystem of the irreducible hardly
ramified `ρbar`, and hardly ramified eigenform realizations with
jointly injective coordinates interpolating the `−t q` (the exact
output vocabulary of pillar 3a-i,
`exists_heckeAlgebra_realizations_of_matchesResidualTraces`) — carries
the Hecke elements to the embedded coefficient system of a normalized
weight-2 eigenform: `μ (t q) = ι (a_q(f))` away from a finite set.

Intended (non-vacuous) discharge, at the honest `T = 𝕋_𝔪` of 3a-i —
the Deligne–Serre eigensystem decomposition of `𝕋_𝔪 ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ` read at
one point (Deligne–Serre, Ann. Sci. ÉNS 7 (1974), the Lemme 6.11
shape; Diamond–Shurman §5.8/§6.5):

1. `ker μ` is a prime of `T` (`ℚ̄_ℓ` is a domain); the coordinates
   `(real i).toFun =: λᵢ` are jointly injective, so
   `∏ᵢ ker λᵢ ⊆ ⋂ᵢ ker λᵢ = 0 ⊆ ker μ` and primality selects an `i`
   with `ker λᵢ ⊆ ker μ`: the point factors through the `i`-th
   eigenform component `λᵢ(T) ⊆ Oᵢ`.
2. The factored map is injective on `λᵢ(T)`: `μ` fixes `ℤ`, so `ℓ` is
   not in its kernel, while at the honest instantiation `λᵢ(T)` is an
   order in the `ℓ`-adic coefficient field `Eᵢ` and every nonzero
   prime of such an order contains `ℓ`. Hence the point extends to a
   field embedding `Eᵢ ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ`.
3. `Eᵢ` is the completed Hecke field of the newform component `fᵢ`
   attached to the `i`-th realization by the 3a-i construction, with
   `λᵢ(t q)` the image of `a_q(fᵢ)`; composing the embedding of step 2
   with `heckeField N fᵢ → Eᵢ` gives `ι`, and `μ (t q) = ι (a_q(fᵢ))`
   off the finitely many junk primes.

The abstract `HardlyRamifiedRealization` does not carry its eigenform,
so steps 2–3 are the eigenform-attachment strengthening of 3a-i's
interface: this leaf's discharge must be COORDINATED WITH
`exists_heckeAlgebra_realizations_of_matchesResidualTraces` (whose
classical construction produces the `fᵢ`), either by enriching that
leaf's conclusion or by discharging the two together over a common
construction — and must not duplicate the Hecke-operator development
above (`heckeTransform`/`exists_heckeMatrix_eigenvector`), which
supplies the `IsWeightTwoEigenform` certificates for the constructed
components. Soundness of the abstract quantification: the section
audit (the hypothesis set contains the classically unsatisfiable
irreducible hardly ramified `ρbar`; the construction above is the
non-vacuous intended discharge). CIRCULARITY GUARD: must not be proven
through `Family.lean` (see the section docstring). -/

finite-algebra half of pillar 3c
(`exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_heckeDeformation_point` below) shows
every `ℚ̄_ℓ`-point of `T` factors this way, with `O = T ⧸ ker lam`.

The abstract package `(T, ρT, π)` carries no Hecke structure of its
own, so the proof executes the recorded Deligne–Serre/Carayol route
at the `T = 𝕋_𝔪` instantiation of pillar 3a by RECONSTRUCTING the
honest Hecke package from the residual data and identifying it with
`T` through the universal deformation ring:

1. residual modularity (pillar 2, a proven assembly over the
   Khare–Wintenberger headline and `ModThree`) turns `(ρbar, hirr)`
   into an eigenform match `(N₀, f₀, hmatch₀)`;
2. the Carayol cut behind pillar 3a rebuilds the localized Hecke
   algebra: 3a-i (`exists_heckeAlgebra_realizations_of_...`) gives the
   coefficient package `(T₀, t, π₀)` with its eigenform realizations,
   and the PROVEN Chebotarev gluing plus the descent leaf 3a-ii give
   Carayol's hardly ramified `ρT₀` with `charFrob.coeff 1 = −t q`;
3. Mazur representability (`Patching.lean`, pillar 3b-i) classifies
   BOTH hardly ramified finite deformations of `ρbar` — the given
   abstract `(T, ρT, π)` by `ψ : Runiv →+* T` and the Hecke package
   `(T₀, ρT₀, π₀)` by `ψ₀ : Runiv →+* T₀` — and Carayol surjectivity
   (3b-ii) plus Taylor–Wiles injectivity (3b-iii) upgrade `ψ₀` to a
   ring isomorphism, exactly the `R = 𝕋` mechanism of the pillar-3b
   assembly above;
4. the order point `j ∘ φ` of `T` transports along `ψ ∘ ψ₀⁻¹` to a
   ring-homomorphism point `μ` of the Hecke package, with
   `μ (t q) = − j (φ ((charFrob ρT).coeff 1))` by the two trace
   compatibilities;
5. the Deligne–Serre point leaf evaluates `μ` to an embedded
   eigensystem `μ (t q) = ι (a_q(f))`, which is the required
   conclusion up to the file's sign convention.

The order structure (`O` a domain, `ℤ_ℓ`-free; `j` injective) is
consumed only in forming the point — it is exactly what the proven
finite-algebra half below produces, and the shape the classical
Deligne–Serre reading of a point uses. The alternative discharge for
the abstract package — Kisin's Fontaine–Mazur theorem (*The
Fontaine–Mazur conjecture for `GL₂`*, JAMS 22 (2009)) applied to the
pushforward of `ρT` along `φ`: geometric (hardly ramified), odd
(determinant cyclotomic), residually irreducible (`ker φ ⊆ 𝔪_T` since
`T` is local, so the residue field of `O` is `T ⧸ 𝔪_T ≅ k` and the
reduction is `ρbar`) — remains recorded as the route NOT taken: the
Hecke-algebra route consumes only leaves already in the tree plus the
sharply-scoped point leaf above.

/-- **Modular points of the Hecke-side deformation** (pillar 3c;
DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 — now a PROVEN assembly over the order-point
leaf above): every `ℚ̄_ℓ`-valued point `lam` of a Hecke-side hardly
ramified deformation `(T, ρT, π)` of an irreducible hardly ramified
`ρbar` carries the Frobenius-trace system of `ρT` to the coefficient
system of a normalized weight-2 eigenform under an embedding of its
Hecke field (sign convention as everywhere in this file: the
`charFrob` linear coefficient is `−a_q`).

The PROVEN finite-algebra half ("points factor through orders", the
points-as-projections content of the Deligne–Serre decomposition of
`𝕋_𝔪 ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ` in kernel form): the kernel of `lam` is a prime of `T`
(`ℚ̄_ℓ` is a domain), so `O := T ⧸ ker lam` is a domain, local
(quotient of the local `T`), module-finite over `ℤ_ℓ`, and of
characteristic zero — any ring homomorphism from `ℤ_ℓ` to the
characteristic-zero field `ℚ̄_ℓ` is injective, since a nonzero
`z ∈ ℤ_ℓ` is a unit times `ℓ^n` (DVR) and `ℓ` maps to `ℓ ≠ 0` — so
`O` is `ℤ_ℓ`-torsion-free, hence FREE over the DVR `ℤ_ℓ`: an order
in an `ℓ`-adic field. `lam` factors through it as the kernel-lift
embedding `j : O ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ` composed with the quotient surjection
`φ : T ↠ O`. The remaining geometric half — order-valued points are
eigenform systems (Deligne–Serre on `𝕋_𝔪`, Kisin's Fontaine–Mazur
for the abstract package; see its docstring) — is the sorried leaf
`exists_weightTwoEigenform_of_heckeDeformation_order_point` above,
evaluated at `(O, φ, j)`.

/-- **Modularity lifting** (pillar 3; DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 — now a
PROVEN assembly over the Taylor–Wiles cut of the section above; the
R = T shadow, residually irreducible case): a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation whose residual representation is irreducible and
modular (in the `MatchesResidualTraces` sense) is itself modular: its
Frobenius traces arise, away from a finite set of places, from a
single weight-2 eigenform under a single embedding of its Hecke field.
The hardly ramified hypotheses on `ρ` instantiate exactly the
classical deformation conditions of the FLT blueprint's lifting
theorem (ch. 4, "`S`-good" with `S = {2}`): determinant cyclotomic,
unramified outside `2p`, flat at `p` (weight 2), tame at `2` with
unramified square-trivial rank-1 quotient. Literature: Wiles, *Modular
elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem*, Ann. of Math. 141 (1995),
ch. 3 and 5; Taylor–Wiles, *Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke
algebras*, ibid. (the patching input); Conrad–Diamond–Taylor and
Diamond's refinements for the flat deformation condition at `p`; in
the "geometric odd irreducible 2-dimensional `p`-adic representations
of `Γ ℚ` are modular" formulation this is the relevant case of the
Fontaine–Mazur conjecture (Kisin, *The Fontaine–Mazur conjecture for
GL₂*, JAMS 22 (2009); Pan for the `p = 3` corners). The decomposition
aligns the deformation-problem bookkeeping with
`Fermat/FLT/Deformations/` (`GaloisRep`, `IsFlatAt`/flat
prolongations) as planned: the proof runs pillar 3a on the residual
data, pillar 3b against `ρ` itself, and evaluates pillar 3c at the
`ℚ̄_p`-point `(algebraMap R ℚ̄_p).comp Φ` of the Hecke-side
deformation; the residual hardly-ramifiedness and the surjectivity of
the residue map are consumed by 3a/3b exactly as the Taylor–Wiles
hypotheses. -/

/-! ### The Eisenstein cut behind the residually reducible branch

Pillar 4's `p ≥ 5` leaf DECOMPOSED (2026-07-24), following the audit
below, into the LEVEL-2 EISENSTEIN CONTRADICTION (Mazur) — not into
Skinner–Wiles patching machinery.

AUDIT (2026-07-24, both directions):

* *Reachability.* The leaf IS genuinely reachable with formally
  unrefuted hypotheses: the dichotomy in
  `exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_isIrreducible` performs
  `by_cases` on residual irreducibility with NO information about
  which branch obtains — pillar 1's residue field is abstract, and
  `Family.lean`'s trace atoms invoke the chain on arbitrary hardly
  ramified `p`-adic representations (compatible-family members) with
  no residual data. Nor can `Reducible.lean`'s B5
  (`not_isIrreducible_of_isHardlyRamified`, which makes every hardly
  ramified residual representation at `ℓ ≥ 5` reducible) be invoked
  to trivialize either branch: B5 is DOWNSTREAM of this file (its
  proof runs through `Lift.lean` and `Family.lean`, which consume the
  assemblies here), so any such route is circular. A
  hypothesis-narrowing redesign (threading residual irreducibility of
  the `Lift.lean` lift through the chain so the reducible branch is
  never taken) would rewrite proven consumers' signatures across
  three files and is rejected.

* *Content.* The leaf's hypothesis set — hardly ramified `p`-adic
  `ρ`, irreducible over `ℚ̄_p`, residually REDUCIBLE, `p ≥ 5` — is
  classically EMPTY, and, unlike the residually irreducible branch
  (where emptiness is the full Wiles chain), its emptiness has a
  classical proof strictly shallower than Skinner–Wiles: Mazur's
  level-2 Eisenstein argument. The residual Jordan–Hölder characters
  are `1` and `ω = χ̄_cyc` (pillar E1 below); Ribet's lattice lemma
  converts irreducibility over `ℚ̄_p` into a NONSPLIT hardly ramified
  extension with trivial sub-character (pillar E2); and that
  extension group vanishes at `p ≥ 5` (pillar E3 — Herbrand's theorem
  at `B₂ = 1/6` plus the triviality of the conductor-2 ray; in
  Hecke-algebra language, the index of the level-`N` Eisenstein ideal
  is `num((N−1)/12)`, which is `1` at `N = 2`). Full Skinner–Wiles
  (Publ. Math. IHÉS 89, 1999) or Pan (JAMS 35, 2022) is needed only
  at general conductor; at conductor dividing `2` any honest
  modularity conclusion is contradiction-shaped anyway
  (`S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` is proven above) — the same boundary phenomenon
  audited at pillar 5. The leaf is therefore discharged by
  contradiction, exactly like its `p = 3` instance (3-adic
  classification), with the depth living in the sorried Eisenstein
  pillars — E1's two arithmetic pinning leaves (E1a ray-class, E1b
  Raynaud flat weight; E1's triangular shape and assembly are PROVEN,
  2026-07-24) plus E2 and E3.

* *`p ≥ 5` is load-bearing:* pillar E3 is FALSE at `p = 3` — there
  `ω^{−1} = ω`, and the Kummer class of `2` (the extension cut out by
  `ℚ(μ₃, 2^{1/3})`: unramified outside `{2, 3}`, tame at `2` since
  the degree `3` is odd, flat at `3`) is a nonsplit hardly ramified
  inhabitant; it is the same class `ModThree.lean`'s classification
  lives with. The `2`-ramified escape closes exactly when
  `p ∤ 2² − 1 = 3`.

CIRCULARITY GUARD (inherited, mandatory): E1–E3 must not be proven
through `Family.lean` (it consumes this file's assemblies) nor
through `Reducible.lean`'s B5 (downstream of this file through
`Lift.lean` and `Family.lean`). -/

/-- **The residual triangular shape** (Eisenstein pillar E1, shape
half; PROVEN 2026-07-24 — pure linear algebra, no arithmetic input):
a rank-2 representation over a field `k` that is NOT irreducible has
a one-dimensional stable subspace (any proper nonzero invariant
subspace of a two-dimensional space has dimension `1`), and extending
a spanning vector of that line to a basis triangularizes the action;
the diagonal entries are multiplicative — hence CHARACTERS — because
coordinates in a basis are unique. Follows the proven
Step-B/eigenvalue pattern of
`exists_global_triangular_of_residual_trivial_quotient`
(`Threeadic.lean`), simplified from the local ring `R` to the field
`k`. -/

/-- **Conductor-`2p` ray-class pinning of the sub-character**
(Eisenstein pillar E1a; sorry node — the Kronecker–Weber input of the
residual Eisenstein classification): the sub-character of a
triangular hardly ramified mod-`p` representation is a POWER of the
mod-`p` cyclotomic character `ω` (the image of the `p`-adic
cyclotomic character under `ℤ_p → k`, which factors through
`𝔽_p ⊆ k` because the kernel of any ring homomorphism from `ℤ_p` to
the finite field `k` is the nonzero prime `(p)`). Classical proof:
`χsub` is continuous (a matrix entry of the continuous `ρbar`) of
finite order prime to `p` (values in `k^×`); it is unramified outside
`{2, p}` because `ρbar` is (`IsHardlyRamified.isUnramified`: inertia
outside `2p` lies in `ker ρbar`, so it fixes the stable line
pointwise); it is unramified at `2` because the local Jordan–Hölder
multiset of `ρbar|_{G_2}` is `{κ, δ}` with `δ` unramified
(`IsHardlyRamified.isTameAtTwo`) and `κ·δ = det ρbar = ω` unramified
at `2`, while the semisimplification of the triangular `ρbar|_{G_2}`
is `χsub|_2 ⊕ χquo|_2` (uniqueness of Jordan–Hölder factors /
Brauer–Nesbitt), so `{χsub|_2, χquo|_2} = {κ, δ}` consists of
unramified characters; and a continuous character of `Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)`
unramified outside `p` factors through `Gal(ℚ(μ_{p^∞})/ℚ) ≅ ℤ_p^×` —
the ray class group of `ℚ` of conductor `2p^k∞` is
`(ℤ/2p^k)^× ≅ (ℤ/p^k)^×` (Kronecker–Weber; Neukirch, *Algebraic
Number Theory*, VI §6–7) — where its prime-to-`p` order kills the
pro-`p` factor `1 + pℤ_p`, so it factors through
`Gal(ℚ(μ_p)/ℚ) ≅ (ℤ/p)^×`, whose group of characters with values in
`k^×` is generated by `ω`. Soundness (audit 2026-07-24): the
hypothesis set is inhabited (`1 ⊕ ω` in triangular form) and the
conclusion holds for every inhabitant by the argument cited; `p ≥ 5`
is not consumed. CIRCULARITY GUARD (inherited from the section

/-- **Raynaud flat-weight pinning of the sub-character** (Eisenstein
pillar E1b; sorry node — the finite-flat input of the residual
Eisenstein classification): a power `ω^i` of the mod-`p` cyclotomic
character occurring as the sub-character of a (flat at `p`)
triangular hardly ramified representation has inertia weight `0` or
`1` — i.e. equals `1` or `ω` GLOBALLY (only the residue of `i` mod
`p − 1` matters, since `ω` takes values in `𝔽_p^× ⊆ k^×`). Classical
proof: flatness (`IsHardlyRamified.isFlat`) makes `ρbar|_{G_p}` the
generic fibre of a finite flat group scheme over `ℤ_p` killed by `p`;
sub- and quotient objects of such group schemes are finite flat
(scheme-theoretic closure; Tate in Cornell–Silverman–Stevens ch. V),
so the stable line is itself the generic fibre of a finite flat
character scheme, and for `e = 1 < p − 1` its Jordan–Hölder character
restricted to inertia is `ω^0` or `ω^1` (Raynaud, *Schémas en groupes
de type `(p, …, p)`*, Bull. Soc. Math. France 102 (1974), 3.3.2;
Serre, Duke Math. J. 54 (1987), §2.4); `ω` restricted to inertia at
`p` is the level-1 fundamental character, of EXACT order `p − 1` on
tame inertia (Serre, loc. cit., §1.3, 1.7), so
`ω^i|_{I_p} ∈ {1, ω|_{I_p}}` forces `i ≡ 0` or `1 mod (p − 1)`,
i.e. `χsub = 1` or `χsub = ω` globally. Soundness (audit 2026-07-24):
the hypothesis set is inhabited (`1 ⊕ ω` in triangular form realizes

/-! #### The Ribet cut behind pillar E2 (2026-07-24)

Pillar E2 below carries two classically independent pieces of work,
and is now a PROVEN assembly over their separation (the split recorded
in its original docstring):

* **E2a — the DVR lattice combinatorics** (Ribet's lemma with
  prescribed order): produce, from the irreducible-generic /
  reducible-residual situation, a NEW coefficient ring `O` (a
  module-finite local topological `ℤ_p`-domain — the valuation ring of
  the `p`-adic field `Frac R`, carried with exactly the typeclass
  bundle of `R` so that the pillar-1 residual machinery of
  `Residual.lean` applies to it verbatim), a lattice representation
  `ρO` on the standard rank-2 frame, its generic-fibre identification
  with `ρ` over `ℚ̄_p`, a residue package `O ↠ kk'`, and the reduction
  `ρE` in nonsplit triangular form with TRIVIAL sub-character. This is
  self-contained lattice-walking over a DVR plus Brauer–Nesbitt
  bookkeeping; no hardly-ramifiedness is asserted anywhere in its
  conclusion.

* **E2b — the per-field hardly-ramifiedness transfer**: from
  `IsHardlyRamified ρ` and the E2a linkage alone, conclude
  `IsHardlyRamified ρE`. Determinant and outside-`2p` unramifiedness
  descend through the generic equivariance and the injectivity
  `O ↪ ℚ̄_p`; flatness at `p` passes to the stable lattice by
  scheme-theoretic closure (sub- and quotient objects of finite flat
  group schemes over `ℤ_p` are finite flat — Raynaud) and then to the
  reduction by the pillar-1 transfer; the tame quotient line at `2`
  saturates in the new lattice with the same unramified square-trivial
  character; the frame identification `er` is crossed by conjugation.

The circularity guard of the section applies to both halves: neither
may be proven through `Family.lean` or `Reducible.lean`'s B5. -/

/-- **Ribet's lattice walk** (Eisenstein pillar E2a; sorry node — the
DVR lattice-combinatorics half of the Ribet cut behind pillar E2, with
prescribed order of the residual characters): a hardly ramified
`p`-adic representation that is irreducible over `ℚ̄_p` but residually
reducible — with the residual triangular data of pillar E1 — admits a
stable lattice over the valuation ring `O` of `Frac R` whose reduction
is a NONSPLIT triangular representation with TRIVIAL sub-character on
the standard frame. Classical construction: `E := Frac R` is a finite
extension of `ℚ_p` (`R` is a module-finite `ℤ_p`-domain and `hZinj`
keeps it of characteristic zero), and its valuation ring `O` is a
complete DVR, module-finite over `ℤ_p`, local, compact in its module
topology — exactly the typeclass bundle carried by `R`, which is why
the conclusion re-exports it wholesale; the given map `R → ℚ̄_p` is
injective (its kernel is a prime of the one-dimensional domain `R`
meeting `ℤ_p` trivially, hence zero by integrality), extends to
`E ↪ ℚ̄_p`, and restricts to `O ↪ ℚ̄_p` compatibly with the
`ℤ_p`-structures (the compatibility equation in the conclusion);
`ρ ⊗ E` is irreducible (irreducibility descends from `ℚ̄_p` along
`hirr`) and stabilizes an `O`-lattice (continuity + compactness of the
image), so after a frame choice there is `ρO` on `Fin 2 → O` with a
`ℚ̄_p`-equivariant generic identification `e` to `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p`. The
residual semisimplification of any such lattice is `χsub ⊕ χquo`
pushed along the residue extension `kk → kk'` (Brauer–Nesbitt: both
reductions share the traces of `ρ`), and the two characters are
DISTINCT — their product is the mod-`p` cyclotomic character `ω` by
the determinant field of `hρ`, and one of them is trivial by `hdisj`,
while `ω ≠ 1` because `p` is odd — so Ribet's lemma in its
prescribed-order form (Ribet, *A modular construction of unramified
`p`-extensions of `ℚ(μ_p)`*, Invent. Math. 34 (1976), Prop. 2.1;
Bellaïche–Chenevier, *Families of Galois representations and Selmer
groups*, Astérisque 324 (2009), ch. 1: for a residually multiplicity-
free representation that is generically irreducible BOTH orderings of
the residual characters are realized by suitable stable lattices, with
nonsplit reduction) produces the lattice whose reduction `ρE` has
sub-character `1`, quotient character `χ` (the image of the nontrivial
member of `{χsub, χquo}`), and no coboundary writing of the upper-right
entry. The residue package (`hsurj'`/`hopen'`/`hker'`) is the
general-`p` residue package of `Residual.lean` applied to `O`.
Soundness (audit 2026-07-24): the hypothesis set is classically empty
(section audit), but every step above consumes exactly the listed
hypotheses and none consumes the emptiness; `p ≥ 5` is not consumed
(oddness gives `ω ≠ 1`). Circularity guard: must not route through
`Family.lean` or `Reducible.lean`'s B5. -/

/-- **Lattice-level hardly-ramifiedness transfer** (Eisenstein pillar
E2b′; sorry node — the genuinely deep arithmetic half of the Ribet
cut: a stable lattice of a hardly ramified representation is hardly
ramified): from `IsHardlyRamified ρ`, the generic-fibre equivariance
`e` over `ℚ̄_p`, the injectivity `O ↪ ℚ̄_p` and its
`ℤ_p`-compatibility alone — no irreducibility, no residual-shape
input — the lattice representation `ρO` on the standard rank-2
`O`-frame is itself hardly ramified. Classical proof, field by field:
DETERMINANT — `det (ρO g)` maps under the injection `O ↪ ℚ̄_p` to
`det ((ρO ⊗ ℚ̄_p) g) = det ((ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p) g)` (conjugation by `e`
preserves determinants; `LinearMap.det_baseChange` computes both
sides from the integral models), which is the image of the cyclotomic
determinant of `hρ.det` by the compatibility equation `hZOcompat`, so
`det ∘ ρO` is cyclotomic over `O` by injectivity; UNRAMIFIEDNESS
outside `2p` — inertia acts trivially on the generic fibre through
`e` and `hρ.isUnramified`, and the finite free module `Fin 2 → O`
over the domain `O` injects into its `ℚ̄_p`-fibre (`hOinj`), so
inertia lands in the kernel of `ρO` itself; FLATNESS at `p` — for
every open ideal `I ⊆ O` the finite quotient `(Fin 2 → O) ⊗ O/I` is
a subquotient of a finite level of the original flat tower (the two
lattices are commensurable inside the common generic fibre `e`), and
sub- and quotient objects of finite flat group schemes over `ℤ_p`
are finite flat (scheme-theoretic closure: Raynaud, *Schémas en
groupes de type `(p, …, p)`*, Bull. Soc. Math. France 102 (1974);
Tate, in Cornell–Silverman–Stevens ch. V), so the prolongations of
`hρ.isFlat` induce prolongations of the lattice tower; TAMENESS at
`2` — the rank-1 unramified square-trivial quotient `(π, δ)` of
`hρ.isTameAtTwo` cuts a `G_2`-stable line in the generic fibre; its
saturation in the new lattice is a rank-1 free quotient of
`Fin 2 → O` on which `G_2` acts by the SAME character `δ` read
through `O` (its generic values are `δ ⊗ E`, integral because the
quotient lattice is stable, unramified and square-trivial because
`δ` is). Soundness (audit 2026-07-24): the hypothesis set is
classically INHABITED (take `O = R`, `ρO` a frame of `ρ`, `e` the
identity — no irreducibility is assumed), and the conclusion holds
for every inhabitant by the cited transfers; hypothesis-honest: no
step consumes `p ≥ 5`, irreducibility, or any residual data.

/-- **The Eisenstein lattice** (Eisenstein pillar E2; PROVEN
2026-07-24 as an assembly over the Ribet cut E2a/E2b above — E2a
supplies the lattice representation `ρO`, its generic-fibre
identification with `ρ`, the residue package and the nonsplit
triangular reduction `ρE`; E2b transfers the four hardly ramified
fields onto `ρE`; the assembly only proves the rank of the standard
frame and reshuffles the data): a hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation that is irreducible over `ℚ̄_p` but residually
reducible — with the residual triangular data of pillar E1 — reduces,
on a suitable stable lattice over the valuation ring of `Frac R`
(finite over `ℚ_p` since `R` is a module-finite `ℤ_p`-domain), to a
NONSPLIT hardly ramified extension with TRIVIAL sub-character: in
matrix form `!![1, cc g; 0, χ g]` on the standard basis of `kk'²`,
with no `a` satisfying `∀ g, cc g = (χ g − 1) a` (the coboundary
criterion: such an `a` marks a stable complement `e₁ + a·e₀`).
Classical construction: `E := Frac R` is a finite extension of `ℚ_p`;
`ρ ⊗ E` is irreducible (irreducibility descends from `ℚ̄_p`); its
residual semisimplification is `1 ⊕ ω` by the E1 data on the given
reduction (independence of the reduction: Brauer–Nesbitt); the two
characters are DISTINCT (`ω ≠ 1` for odd `p`), so Ribet's lemma in
its prescribed-order form — Ribet, *A modular construction of
unramified `p`-extensions of `ℚ(μ_p)`*, Invent. Math. 34 (1976),
Prop. 2.1; Bellaïche–Chenevier, *Families of Galois representations
and Selmer groups*, Astérisque 324 (2009), ch. 1: for an irreducible
generic representation BOTH orderings are realized by suitable stable
lattices — produces a stable `𝒪_E`-lattice whose reduction is
nonsplit with sub-character `1`. The reduction is hardly ramified by
the same residual-transfer arguments as pillar 1 (`Residual.lean`):
determinant and outside-`2p` unramifiedness pass to any reduction;
flatness at `p` passes to stable lattices and their reductions
(scheme-theoretic closure — sub- and quotient objects of finite flat
group schemes over `ℤ_p` are finite flat; Raynaud, loc. cit.; Tate in
Cornell–Silverman–Stevens ch. V); the tame quotient line at `2`
saturates inside the new lattice with the same unramified
square-trivial character. Soundness (audit 2026-07-24): the
hypothesis set is classically empty (section audit), but the cited
derivation is hypothesis-honest — every step consumes exactly the
listed hypotheses and none consumes the emptiness; `p ≥ 5` is not
consumed (oddness gives `ω ≠ 1`), so it is not demanded. -/

/-- **Flat local splitting at `p`** (Eisenstein pillar E3a; sorry node
— the connected–étale splitting of the flat model): a hardly ramified
mod-`p` extension with TRIVIAL sub-character splits LOCALLY AT `p`:
some `a : kk'` writes the upper-right entry as a coboundary on the
whole image of the decomposition group at `p`. Classical proof:
flatness at `p` (`hρE.isFlat`) gives a finite flat group scheme over
`ℤ_p` with generic fibre `ρE|_{G_p}`; the scheme-theoretic closure of
the trivial sub-line is the UNIQUE prolongation of the trivial
rank-one representation (Raynaud, Bull. Soc. Math. France 102 (1974),
3.3.3: prolongations are unique for `e ≤ p − 2`, here `e = 1`), namely
the constant étale sub, and the quotient is the unique prolongation of
`ω`, the `μ_p`-type connected model; a finite flat extension with
étale SUB and connected QUOTIENT is split by its own connected–étale
sequence — the identity component meets the étale sub trivially,
injects into the connected quotient, and matches its order, hence is a
group-scheme section (Tate, in Cornell–Silverman–Stevens, ch. V;
Mazur, Publ. Math. IHÉS 47 (1977), ch. I: `Ext¹(μ_p, ℤ/p) = 0` over
`ℤ_p`). Generic fibres give a `G_p`-stable complement `e₁ + a·e₀`,
i.e. exactly the coboundary equation below. Soundness (audit
2026-07-24): the hypothesis set is inhabited (split triangulars
`1 ⊕ ω`), the conclusion holds for every inhabitant by the cited
route, which consumes only oddness of `p` (`e = 1 ≤ p − 2` needs
`p ≥ 3`) — `p ≥ 5` is NOT needed, so it is not demanded. Note the
load-bearing asymmetry of orderings: in the OPPOSITE (trivial-quotient,
`μ_p`-sub) order the local extensions form
`Ext¹(ℤ/p, μ_p) = ℤ_pˣ ⊗ 𝔽_p ≠ 0` (unit Kummer classes, e.g. the
Kummer class of `2` for every `p`), which is exactly why pillar E2
must PRESCRIBE the trivial-sub order for its lattice. -/

/-- **Tame local splitting at `2`** (Eisenstein pillar E3b; sorry node
— the at-2 unit analysis; `hp5` is load-bearing HERE): a hardly
ramified mod-`p` extension with TRIVIAL sub-character, `p ≥ 5`, splits
locally at `2`. Classical proof, in two strokes. (i) *Killing
inertia*: `χ` is pinned to `ω = χ̄_cyc` by the determinant of `htri`
against `hρE.det`, and `ω` is unramified at `2`, so on (the image of)
the inertia subgroup `I_2` the function `cc` is a plain homomorphism
into `(kk', +)` — a pro-`p` target, killed by wild (pro-2) inertia,
hence factoring through the tame quotient, on which a Frobenius lift
`F` acts by `t ↦ t²`; the conjugation identity
`cc(σ n σ⁻¹) = χ(σ)⁻¹ · cc(n)` for `n ∈ ker χ` (pure cocycle algebra
from `htri`) applied to tame `n` gives `2 · cc(n) = χ(F)⁻¹ · cc(n)`
with `χ(F) = ω(Frob₂) = 2`, so `(2 − 2⁻¹) · cc(n) = 0` and
`2 − 2⁻¹ = 3/2 ≠ 0` in characteristic `p` exactly when
`p ∤ 2² − 1 = 3` — excluded by `hp5`. This is the tame escape that the
section audit's `p = 3` Kummer-of-2 counterexample rides
(`v_2(2) = 1 ≢ 0 mod 3`: tamely ramified at `2`). (ii) *Killing the
unramified part*: `a := cc(F)/(χ(F) − 1)` is well-formed since
`χ(F) − 1 = 2 − 1 = 1 ≠ 0` (more generally `p ∤ 2 − 1` always kills
`H¹_ur(ℚ_2, ω^{−1})`), and correcting `cc` by its coboundary yields a
continuous cocycle vanishing on `I_2` and on `F`, hence on the closed
subgroup they topologically generate — all of `G_2`, the unramified
quotient being procyclic on `Frob₂` (the finite-level tame generator
machinery of `ModThree.lean`,
`exists_finite_level_tame_frobenius_generator_two` and
`localInertia_two_eq_map_padic`, is the intended formal route; Serre,
Duke Math. J. 54 (1987), §4.1 runs this at-2 computation). Soundness
(audit 2026-07-24): the hypothesis set is inhabited (split
triangulars), the conclusion holds for every inhabitant — for `p ≥ 5`
in fact `H¹(ℚ_2, ω^{−1}) = 0` outright (local Euler characteristic
plus `h⁰ = h² = 0` from `p ∤ 2 − 1` and `p ∤ 2² − 1`) — and the route
is hypothesis-honest: `hp5` is consumed at the tame escape `p ∤ 3` and
nowhere else. -/

/-- **Kernel vanishing — Herbrand at `B₂`** (Eisenstein pillar E3c;
sorry node — the class-field-theory pillar, the deep arithmetic input
of the residually reducible branch): a hardly ramified mod-`p`
extension with TRIVIAL sub-character that splits locally at `p` and at
`2` has `cc` vanishing IDENTICALLY on `ker χ`. Classical proof:
`χ = ω = χ̄_cyc` is pinned by the determinant of `htri` against
`hρE.det`, so `ker χ = G_{ℚ(μ_p)}`; on the kernel the twisted cocycle
relation (from `htri`) degenerates and `φ := cc|_{ker χ}` is a
continuous homomorphism into `(kk', +)`, with the conjugation
equivariance `φ(σ n σ⁻¹) = χ(σ)⁻¹ · φ(n)` (cocycle algebra:
`cc(σ n σ⁻¹) = cc(σ⁻¹) + (cc(n) + cc(σ)) χ(σ)⁻¹` and
`cc(σ⁻¹) + cc(σ) χ(σ)⁻¹ = cc(1) = 0`). `φ` kills every inertia
subgroup of `ker χ`: over `ℓ ∉ {2, p}` because `ρE` is literally
trivial on inertia there (`hρE.isUnramified`); over `2` and `p`
because the decomposition subgroups are the `Γℚ`-conjugates of the
images of `Γℚ_2`, `Γℚ_p`, on which `cc` is the given coboundary —
vanishing on `ker χ` since coboundaries do — and vanishing transports
along the conjugation identity. So `φ` factors through the Galois
group of the maximal abelian everywhere-unramified `p`-elementary
extension of `ℚ(μ_p)`, i.e. through `Cl(ℚ(μ_p)) ⊗ 𝔽_p` (Artin
reciprocity for the Hilbert class field; Neukirch, *Algebraic Number
Theory*, VI §6–7), equivariantly for `Gal(ℚ(μ_p)/ℚ)`; a nonzero `φ`
would exhibit a nonzero `ω^{−1} = ω^{1−2}`-eigenspace of
`Cl(ℚ(μ_p)) ⊗ 𝔽_p`, which Herbrand's theorem forbids:
`p ∤ num(B₂) = num(1/6) = 1`, with `k = 2` inside the window
`2 ≤ k ≤ p − 3` — the second consumption of `hp5` (Herbrand 1932;
Washington, *Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields*, Thm. 6.17; Ribet,
Invent. Math. 34 (1976) is the unused converse). Intended further cut
for the successor, top-down: (i) found the `Gal`-action on
`ClassGroup (𝓞 (CyclotomicField p ℚ))` (via `galRestrict` and
fractional-ideal functoriality — the mathlib pin has NO such action,
audited 2026-07-24, nor any Herbrand/regular-prime material); (ii) the
CFT localization leaf — everywhere-unramified `ω^{−1}`-equivariant
homs factor through the class group; (iii) the sharply separated
Herbrand leaf — the `ω^{−1}`-eigenspace dies for `p ∤ num(B₂)`
(Washington 6.17). Soundness (audit 2026-07-24): the hypothesis set is
inhabited (split extensions), the conclusion holds for every
inhabitant by the vanishing cited, and no elementary route around the
class-group localization is known: this pillar is irreducibly

/-- **Inflation–restriction by finite averaging** (PROVEN 2026-07-24):
for a character `χ` of an arbitrary group with values in a finite
field and a `χ`-twisted cocycle `cc` — the relation
`cc (g h) = cc h + cc g · χ h` of an upper-triangular matrix
representation `!![1, cc; 0, χ]` — vanishing identically on `ker χ`,
the cocycle is a coboundary: `cc g = (χ g − 1) a` for a single fixed
`a`. Coboundaries vanish on `ker χ`, so restriction of the extension
class to the kernel is the homomorphism `cc|_{ker χ}` itself, and this
lemma is the converse direction — concretely the vanishing of
`H¹(G/ker χ, k(χ^{−1}))` for the finite group `G/ker χ ≤ kˣ` of order
prime to the characteristic (inflation–restriction;
Neukirch–Schmidt–Wingberg, *Cohomology of Number Fields*, I §6) —
realized by averaging the cocycle against `χ^{−1}` over the image
`χ(G)`: summing `cc(gh) = cc h + cc g · χ h` weighted by `χ(gh)^{−1}`
over a translated fibre section gives
`S = χ(g)^{−1} S + #χ(G) · χ(g)^{−1} cc(g)`, and `#χ(G)` divides

/-- **Level-2 Eisenstein vanishing** (Eisenstein pillar E3; PROVEN
2026-07-24 as an assembly over the local–global cut E3a–E3c above plus
the finite-averaging inflation–restriction lemma): a hardly ramified
mod-`p` extension with TRIVIAL sub-character SPLITS when `p ≥ 5` —
some `a : kk'` writes the upper-right entry as the coboundary
`cc g = (χ g − 1) a`; equivalently
`H¹_{hardly ramified}(ℚ, ω^{−1}) = 0` in matrix coordinates. The
classical content lives in the three pillars: the class is LOCALLY
TRIVIAL at `p` (E3a — the flat model splits by its own connected–étale
sequence, `Ext¹(μ_p, ℤ/p) = 0` over `ℤ_p`) and at `2` (E3b — tame
Frobenius weights; a ramified part survives only when
`ω²(Frob₂) = 1`, i.e. `p ∣ 2² − 1 = 3`, excluded by `hp5`; the section
audit's `p = 3` Kummer-of-2 counterexample rides exactly that escape),
hence its cocycle vanishes identically on `ker χ` (E3c — Artin
reciprocity into `Cl(ℚ(μ_p)) ⊗ 𝔽_p` and Herbrand's theorem at
`ω^{−1} = ω^{1−2}`, `p ∤ num(B₂) = num(1/6) = 1`, Washington
Thm. 6.17 — the second consumption of `hp5`, through the Herbrand
window `2 ≤ 2 ≤ p − 3`); the assembly is then pure algebra, proven
here: matrix multiplicativity of `htri` yields the χ-twisted cocycle
identity `cc(gh) = cc(h) + cc(g)·χ(h)`, and
`exists_coboundary_of_forall_ker_eq_zero` (finite averaging over the
prime-to-`p` image `χ(Γℚ) ≤ kk'ˣ`) upgrades kernel vanishing to a
global coboundary. In Hecke-algebra language the vanishing is Mazur's:
the index of the Eisenstein ideal at prime level `N` is
`num((N−1)/12)` (*Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal*, Publ.
Math. IHÉS 47 (1977)), which is `1` at `N = 2` — no Eisenstein
congruence exists at conductor `2`, which is why the Skinner–Wiles
congruence machinery has nothing to produce here and the residually
reducible branch terminates in this vanishing instead. Ordering audit
(2026-07-24): the trivial-SUB order is essential — in the opposite
(trivial-quotient, `μ_p`-sub) order the analogous vanishing is FALSE
for EVERY odd `p`: the Kummer class of `2`, cut out by
`ℚ(μ_p, 2^{1/p})`, is a nonsplit hardly ramified inhabitant there,

/-! ### The founder cut behind the conductor leaf (2026-07-24)

The conductor leaf `exists_eigenform_level_dvd_two_of_trace_eq` below
was a single sorry carrying the whole of steps 1–4 of its classical
route (newform descent, Eichler–Shimura attachment, trace rigidity,
Carayol's conductor theorem). The pin has NONE of that vocabulary
(audited in the leaf's docstring), so this section founds it, and the
leaf is now a PROVEN assembly over:

* `IsWeightTwoNewform` +
  `exists_weightTwoNewform_of_weightTwoEigenform` — the newform
  carrier (minimal-level coefficient characterization) and the PROVEN
  descent: behind every normalized eigenform of level `N` lies a
  minimal-level eigenform of some level `M ∣ N` with the same
  eigensystem away from `N` (Diamond–Shurman Prop. 5.8.4; the
  classical content — that the inhabitants are exactly the newforms —
  is the carrier's soundness audit, not a Lean obligation).
* `exists_ringHom_heckeField_of_qCoeff_eq` — PROVEN glue: the given
  `p`-adic embedding of the old form's Hecke field transports to an
  embedding of the newform's Hecke field agreeing on the shared good
  coefficients (extension of embeddings into the algebraically closed
  `ℚ̄_p` along an algebraic extension).
* `exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform` — the
  Eichler–Shimura attachment at general level, the REAL geometric
  leaf (unlike the level-`∣ 2` attachment statements, which are
  discharged by the proven emptiness of their carriers). DECOMPOSED
  2026-07-24 into the Eichler–Shimura cut (see its own section
  docstring below) and now a PROVEN assembly over the single sorried
  inhabitation leaf `nonempty_eichlerShimuraPackage` — the
  modular-Jacobian interface carrier.
* `charFrob_baseChange` and
  `charFrob_map_coeff_zero_of_isHardlyRamified` and
  `eq_quadratic_of_monic_natDegree_two` — PROVEN bookkeeping that
  upgrades the trace matching `hmatch` to FULL characteristic
  polynomial matching: `charFrob` commutes with coefficient base
  change, is monic quadratic, and has constant Frobenius coefficient
  `q` by `det ρ = χ_cyc` (through the Frobenius value of the
  cyclotomic character, `Chebotarev.lean`'s
  `cyclotomicCharacter_globalFrob`).
* `exists_linearEquiv_of_charFrob_eq` — PROVEN (2026-07-24): trace
  rigidity, Chebotarev density + characteristic-zero Brauer–Nesbitt
  over `ℚ̄_p` (density half `trace_eq_of_charFrob_eq`, module-theoretic
  half `nonempty_linearEquiv_of_trace_eq` via mathlib's Jacobson
  density theorem).
* `weightTwoNewform_level_dvd_two_of_isHardlyRamified` — Carayol's
  conductor theorem evaluated on the hardly ramified class; as of
  2026-07-24 itself a PROVEN per-place assembly (see its docstring):
  the hardly-ramified side — transport of `ρ`'s unramifiedness,
  flatness and tame-at-2 structure through the rigidity equivalence
  `e` to `τ`, the fixed-line linear algebra, and the `M ∣ 2`
  arithmetic — is fully PROVEN here, and the literature content is
  isolated in three per-place conductor leaves
  (`weightTwoNewform_not_dvd_level_of_isUnramifiedAt`,
  `weightTwoNewform_not_dvd_level_p_of_isFlatAt`,
  `weightTwoNewform_not_four_dvd_level_of_inertia_two` — Carayol
  1986/Saito 1997 per place) plus the local-arithmetic leaf
  `cyclotomicCharacter_eq_one_of_inertia_two` (the `p`-adic
  cyclotomic character is unramified at `2`, generalizing the PROVEN
  mod-3 instance in `ModThree.lean`). -/

section ConductorCut

/-- **The newform carrier** (Diamond–Shurman §5.8, coefficient-level):
`g ∈ S₂(Γ₀(M))` is a normalized full-Hecke eigenform
(`IsWeightTwoEigenform`, Prop. 5.8.5) whose away-from-`M` prime
eigensystem does not arise from any normalized eigenform of a strictly
smaller level dividing `M` — the *minimal-level* characterization of
newform-ness, the only spelling available on a pin with no newform
theory, no Petersson product and no oldform degeneracy maps.

SOUNDNESS AUDIT (2026-07-24, both directions):

* every classical newform `g` of level `M` inhabits the carrier: it is
  a normalized full-Hecke eigenform (D–S Theorem 5.8.2 with
  Prop. 5.8.5), and no eigenform `g'` of a proper divisor level
  `M' ∣ M` shares its eigensystem away from `M` — behind `g'` lies a
  newform of level `M₀ ∣ M'` with the same away-from-`M'` eigensystem
  (Prop. 5.8.4), which would then share `g`'s eigensystem away from
  `M`, and two distinct newforms never do (strong multiplicity one,
  the Main Lemma engine behind D–S Theorem 5.8.3), while a newform of
  level `M₀ ∣ M' < M` is certainly distinct from `g`;
* conversely every inhabitant is a classical newform: behind it lies a
  newform `g₀` of level `M₀ ∣ M` with the same eigensystem away from
  `M` (Prop. 5.8.4); were `M₀ ≠ M`, then `g₀` itself — a normalized
  full-Hecke eigenform of level `M₀` — would witness exactly what
  `eigensystem_minimal` excludes, so `M₀ = M`; and a normalized
  full-Hecke eigenform of level `M` sharing a level-`M` newform's
  eigensystem away from `M` IS that newform (strong multiplicity one
  again, in the full-eigenvalue form).

Consequently the two sorried leaves below that quantify over this
carrier (`exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform` and
`weightTwoNewform_level_dvd_two_of_isHardlyRamified`) quantify exactly
over the forms for which the classical theory provides attached
representations and conductor control. -/

/-- **Newform descent** (Diamond–Shurman Prop. 5.8.4 in the
minimal-level spelling; PROVEN): behind every normalized weight-2
eigenform of level `N ≥ 1` lies an inhabitant of the minimal-level
newform carrier `IsWeightTwoNewform`, of some level `M ∣ N`, with the
same eigensystem at every prime `q ∤ N`. With the carrier as defined
this is a strong induction on the level: either `f` is already
minimal, or some strictly smaller divisor level realizes its
away-from-`N` eigensystem and the induction hypothesis applies to
that realization; agreement sets compose because a prime not dividing
`N` divides no divisor of `N`. (The analytic content of 5.8.4 — that
the minimal realization is a genuine newform with multiplicity-one
rigidity — lives in the carrier's soundness audit, where it belongs:
no Lean consumer needs more than minimality plus the agreement.) -/

/-- **Transport of the `p`-adic Hecke-field embedding to the newform**
(PROVEN; step 5 of the classical route in the conductor leaf's
docstring): if the eigenform `g` (level `M ≥ 1`) shares the
away-from-`N` prime coefficients of `f`, then any embedding
`ι : K_f → ℚ̄_p` yields an embedding `κ : K_g → ℚ̄_p` agreeing with
`ι` on the shared good coefficients. Pure field theory: the good
coefficients generate a common subfield `E₀` of `ℂ` contained in both
Hecke fields; `K_g` is a number field (`heckeField_finiteDimensional`),
hence algebraic over `E₀`, so the restriction of `ι` to `E₀` extends
to `K_g` because `ℚ̄_p` is algebraically closed (`IsAlgClosed.lift`). -/

/-! ##### The Eichler–Shimura cut behind the attachment leaf (2026-07-24)

`exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform` — the attachment of a
2-dimensional `ℚ̄_p`-representation to a weight-2 newform — was a
single sorry carrying the whole of Diamond–Shurman ch. 8–9. The pin
has NO modular curves, NO Jacobian varieties, NO abelian varieties
(audited 2026-07-24: `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/*` is
Weierstrass-equation material — its `Jacobian/` folder is Jacobian
*coordinates*, not Jacobian varieties — and the reference Lean FLT
project likewise consumes its abelian-variety input, Mazur, as a
stated assumption). So the modular Jacobian enters as an INTERFACE
STRUCTURE (`EichlerShimuraPackage`), in the style of
`HardlyRamifiedRealization` above: its fields are exactly the
classically-true cited facts about the `p`-adic Tate module of
`J₀(M)` that the classical proof of the attachment consumes, and
everything from those facts to the attachment statement is PROVEN:

* `heckeEigenspace`, `compressEnd` — PROVEN linear algebra: the joint
  eigenspace of a prime-indexed operator family, and the compression
  of the endomorphism algebra onto a framed invariant subspace
  through a chosen projection. The compression is a LINEAR map on the
  whole endomorphism algebra (multiplicative only on the stabilizer
  of the subspace, `compressEnd_mul`) — the continuity-compatible
  substitute for restriction, since the module topology sees linear
  maps (`IsModuleTopology.continuous_of_linearMap`) while a bare
  restriction to an abstract submodule has no continuity API.
* `EichlerShimuraPackage` — the modular-Jacobian carrier: the
  Tate-module Galois module `Vp` with its continuous action `τJ`, the
  Hecke operators commuting with the action (`ℚ`-rationality of the
  Hecke correspondences), the Eichler–Shimura congruence at good
  primes, 2-dimensionality of the `κ`-eigenspace (multiplicity one),
  and the Weil-pairing determinant on it.
* `nonempty_eichlerShimuraPackage` — SORRY: the residual geometric
  leaf, inhabitation of the carrier (see its docstring for the
  classical construction, field by field).
* `exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform` — now a PROVEN
  assembly: compress `τJ` to the eigenspace, transport congruence and
  determinant through the compression, and pin the Frobenius
  characteristic polynomial `X² − κ(a_q)·X + q` by Cayley–Hamilton
  against the congruence: the compressed Frobenius is invertible and
  is annihilated by two monic quadratics with equal constant terms
  (`det = q`), which forces equal linear terms. -/

/-- The joint eigenspace of the prime-indexed operator family `t` for
the eigenvalue system `a`: the intersection over all primes `q` of
`ker (t q − a q)`. For the Eichler–Shimura package below this carves

the modular Jacobian. -/

/-- **Inhabitation of the Eichler–Shimura package** (sorry node — THE
residual geometric leaf of the attachment cut, and the only place
where the modular Jacobian itself is consumed): every weight-2
newform `g` of level `M ≥ 1` with a `p`-adic Hecke-field embedding
`κ` admits an Eichler–Shimura package.

Classical construction (Diamond–Shurman ch. 8–9): take
`Vp := V_p(J₀(M)) ⊗_{ℚ_p} ℚ̄_p`, the rational `p`-adic Tate module of
the modular Jacobian (dimension `2·dim S₂(Γ₀(M))`; D–S §6.1 and
ch. 8), with

* `τJ` the Galois action on the Tate module — continuous because the
  action on each `pⁿ`-torsion level factors through a finite
  quotient;
* `hecke m` the Hecke correspondence `T_m` (`U_q` at `q ∣ M`) acting
  through `End(J₀(M)) ⊗ ℚ̄_p`; the modular curve, its Hecke
  correspondences and the Jacobian all have `ℚ`-models (D–S §7.9,
  §8.5), so the operators commute with the Galois action —
  `hecke_comm`;
* `S := {v : v ∣ Mp}`;
* `congruence` — the EICHLER–SHIMURA RELATION (D–S Theorem 8.7.2): at
  a prime `q ∤ Mp` the curve `X₀(M)` has good reduction (Igusa, D–S
  Theorem 8.6.1), reduction identifies the `p`-adic Tate module with
  that of the special fiber (`q ≠ p`), and on the reduced Jacobian
  `T_q = Frob_q + q·⟨q⟩·Frob_q⁻¹` with `⟨q⟩ = 1` on `Γ₀(M)`, i.e.
  `Frob_q² − T_q·Frob_q + q = 0`;
* `rank_eigenspace` — MULTIPLICITY ONE: the joint eigenspace of the
  Hecke operators with eigensystem `κ(a(g))` is
  `V_p(A_g) ⊗_{K_g ⊗ ℚ_p, κ} ℚ̄_p` for the modular abelian variety
  `A_g = J₀(M)/I_g J₀(M)`: `V_p(A_g)` is free of rank 2 over
  `K_g ⊗ ℚ_p` (D–S Lemma 9.5.3), so each `κ`-component is
  2-dimensional, and no other isogeny component of `J₀(M)` carries
  the full eigensystem of the NEWFORM `g` (strong multiplicity one,
  D–S Theorem 5.8.2 with §6.6 — this is where the
  `IsWeightTwoNewform` hypothesis is consumed);
* `det_frob` — the WEIL PAIRING: the Galois determinant on the
  2-dimensional eigencomponent is the `p`-adic cyclotomic character
  (the determinant clause of D–S Theorem 9.5.4, from the Weil pairing
  on `J₀(M)` and triviality of the nebentypus), whose value at the
  `q`-Frobenius is `q`.

SOUNDNESS (2026-07-24): the statement quantifies over inhabitants of
`IsWeightTwoNewform` — exactly the classical newforms (the carrier's
audit above) — and over genuine embeddings `κ` of the Hecke field, so
the classical construction witnesses every instance. The
`hst`-quantified spelling of `det_frob` asserts the determinant
against EVERY stability proof; `LinearMap.restrict` does not depend
on that proof, so this is one fact, not a family. -/

/-- **The Eichler–Shimura attachment at general level** (DECOMPOSED
2026-07-24 into the Eichler–Shimura cut above and now a PROVEN
assembly over the inhabitation leaf
`nonempty_eichlerShimuraPackage`): a weight-2 newform `g` of level
`M ≥ 1`, together with an embedding `κ` of its Hecke field into
`ℚ̄_p`, has an attached 2-dimensional continuous
`ℚ̄_p`-representation of `Γ ℚ` whose Frobenius characteristic
polynomials away from a finite set of places are the Hecke
polynomials `X² − κ(a_q(g))·X + q`.

Assembly: the `κ`-eigenspace `W` of the package's Hecke operators is
Galois-stable (`hecke_comm`) and 2-dimensional (`rank_eigenspace`);
compressing `τJ` through a projection onto `W` and a frame
`W ≃ ℚ̄_p²` (`compressEnd`, multiplicative on the stabilizer, linear
hence continuous for the module topologies) yields the continuous
representation `τ`. At a good prime the compressed Frobenius `F` is
invertible, satisfies the compressed congruence
`F² − κ(a_q)·F + q = 0`, and has `det F = q` (`det_frob` through
`LinearMap.det_conj`); Cayley–Hamilton makes the characteristic
polynomial a second monic quadratic annihilating `F` with the same
constant term `q`, and subtracting the two relations forces the
linear coefficient `−κ(a_q)` — i.e. `charFrob = X² − κ(a_q)·X + q`.
SOUNDNESS: unchanged from the previous audit — the statement asserts
nothing about `τ` beyond the charpoly matching, precisely the input
shape the rigidity and Carayol leaves consume. -/

the trace matching hypothesis of the conductor leaf to FULL

Brauer–Nesbitt. Proof: the constant coefficient of a rank-2
characteristic polynomial is the determinant

the cyclotomic character (the `det` field of `IsHardlyRamified`), and
the cyclotomic character evaluates to `q` at the global Frobenius of

#### Trace rigidity over `ℚ̄_p`: Chebotarev + characteristic-zero
Brauer–Nesbitt (PROVEN, 2026-07-24)

The rigidity leaf `exists_linearEquiv_of_charFrob_eq` is DERIVED here
from two proven halves:

* **Density half** (`trace_eq_of_charFrob_eq`): charpoly agreement at
  the Frobenius elements off a finite set upgrades to TRACE agreement
  at every group element — the agreement locus is closed (traces are
  continuous on the module-topology endomorphism space, `ℚ̄_p` is
  Hausdorff as a normed field) and contains the conjugates of the
  global Frobenius elements, dense by `dense_conjClasses_globalFrob`.
  Only the trace (linear coefficient) of the charpoly is consumed —
  the determinant is not needed anywhere in the argument.

* **Brauer–Nesbitt half** (`nonempty_linearEquiv_of_trace_eq` and its
  Galois-level wrapper `exists_linearEquiv_of_trace_eq`): the abstract
  characteristic-zero statement in dimension 2 — two 2-dimensional
  modules over a `k`-algebra with equal trace functions, the second
  simple, are isomorphic (Curtis–Reiner §30.16, hand-rolled at
  dimension 2). The proof avoids semisimplification bookkeeping: a
  nonzero `A`-hom `M₁ → M₂` is automatically bijective (simplicity of
  `M₂` gives surjectivity, rank–nullity over `k` gives injectivity);
  if no nonzero hom exists, mathlib's Jacobson density theorem
  (`jacobson_density`) applied to the semisimple companion
  (`M₁ × M₂` when `M₁` is simple, `(W × M₁/W) × M₂` for a stable
  line `W` otherwise) produces a ring element acting as the identity
  on `M₂` and as zero on the companion — its two traces are `2` and
  `0` (square-zero endomorphisms are traceless), contradicting
  `char k = 0`. Group-algebra bookkeeping (`MonoidAlgebra ℚ̄_p (Γ ℚ)`
  acting through `Representation.asAlgebraHom`) turns the equivariance
  statement into module language and back.

(PROVEN glue for the Brauer–Nesbitt half): an `A`-linear map between
simple `A`-modules whose `k`-dimensions differ (`k` acting through
central scalars of `A`) is zero — a nonzero one would be bijective by
Schur (`LinearMap.bijective_or_eq_zero`), hence a `k`-linear dimension
isomorphism. -/

core of the characteristic-zero Brauer–Nesbitt argument): given a
semisimple `A`-module `P` and a simple `A`-module `M`, both
finite-dimensional over central scalars `k`, with no nonzero `A`-homs
between `P` and `M` in either direction, some ring element acts as the
identity on `M` and as zero on `P`. The projection of `P × M` onto `M`
commutes with every `A`-endomorphism (hom vanishing kills the
off-diagonal blocks), so mathlib's Jacobson density theorem
(`jacobson_density`, `P × M` is semisimple) realizes it by a ring
element on a finite `k`-spanning set, hence — both sides being
`k`-linear — everywhere. -/

continuous 2-dimensional representations of `Γ ℚ` over `ℚ̄_p` with

density half `trace_eq_of_charFrob_eq` (the trace-agreement locus is
closed and contains the dense Frobenius conjugates, so the traces
agree everywhere — only the linear coefficient of the charpoly is
consumed) and the Brauer–Nesbitt half `exists_linearEquiv_of_trace_eq`

isomorphic; Curtis–Reiner §30.16 hand-rolled at dimension 2 via

/-- **The `p`-adic cyclotomic character is unramified at `2`** (sorry
node — the local-arithmetic leaf of the tame-at-2 transport; for odd
`p` the extension `ℚ_2(μ_{p^∞})/ℚ_2` is unramified): every element of
the inertia at `2` (in the `Z2bar` spelling of
`IsHardlyRamified.isTameAtTwo`) has trivial `p`-adic cyclotomic
character. This is the full-level generalization of the PROVEN mod-3
instance `cyclotomicCharacter_algebraMap_eq_one_of_inertia_two`
(`ModThree.lean`), whose argument is the intended proof at every
level: for each `n` the `p^n`-th roots of unity in `ℚ_[2]ᵃˡᵍ` are
units with pairwise differences of valuation `1` (as `p^n` is odd,
`X^{p^n} − 1` is separable modulo the maximal ideal of `Z2bar`), so an
inertia element — which acts trivially on the residue field — fixes
each of them; via the `lift_map` commuting square its image in `Γ ℚ`
fixes `μ_{p^n} ⊂ ℚᵃˡᵍ`, making the level-`n` cyclotomic character
trivial, and `χ = 1` in `ℤ_[p]ˣ` follows from triviality at every
finite level (`PadicInt.ext_of_toZModPow`). SOUNDNESS: this is the
standard fact that `χ_cyc,p` is unramified away from `p` (Serre,
*Abelian ℓ-adic representations*, I §1.2), specialized to the place
`2 ≠ p`. -/

node — Carayol, *Sur les représentations `ℓ`-adiques associées aux
formes modulaires de Hilbert*, Ann. Sci. ÉNS 19 (1986), Théorème (A);
for weight 2 over `ℚ` the modular-curve cases are Deligne–Rapoport and
Langlands): if a 2-dimensional continuous `ℚ̄_p`-representation `τ`
matching the Hecke polynomials of the weight-2 newform `g` of level
`M ≥ 1` away from a finite set is unramified at a prime `q ≠ p`, then
`q ∤ M`. Classical proof: the attached representation `ρ_{g,λ}` is
irreducible (Ribet, 1977), so Chebotarev density plus Brauer–Nesbitt
identify `τ ≅ ρ_{g,λ} ⊗ ℚ̄_p` from the charpoly matching (both
representations are continuous); Carayol's theorem gives
`ord_q(M) = a_q(ρ_{g,λ})` (the prime-to-`p` Artin conductor exponent)
for `q ≠ p`, and `IsUnramifiedAt` is exactly `a_q = 0`. SOUNDNESS
AUDIT (2026-07-24): the hypotheses are non-vacuously satisfiable —
take any classical newform `g`, `τ := ρ_{g,λ}`, and any good prime `q`
— and the statement quantifies over the `IsWeightTwoNewform` carrier,
whose inhabitants are exactly the classical newforms (carrier
audit), so every instance is an instance of the cited theorems. -/

/-- **The conductor bound at `p`: flat implies `p ∤ M`** (sorry node —
Saito, *Modular forms and `p`-adic Hodge theory*, Invent. Math. 129
(1997), local–global compatibility at `p`, with the weight-2 flatness
input from Raynaud/Fontaine): if the representation `τ` attached (in
the charpoly-matching sense) to the weight-2 newform `g` of level `M`
is equivalent, through `e`, to the base change of an integral
representation `ρ` over the local pro-`p` coefficient ring `R` that is
FLAT at `p` (`GaloisRep.IsFlatAt` — finite flat prolongations of all
finite quotients), then `p ∤ M`. Classical proof: flatness makes
`ρ|_{G_p}` the generic fiber of a `p`-divisible group, hence
crystalline with Hodge–Tate weights in `{0, 1}` (Raynaud, Bull. SMF 102
(1974); Fontaine); by rigidity `τ ≅ ρ_{g,λ} ⊗ ℚ̄_p` (Ribet
irreducibility + Chebotarev/Brauer–Nesbitt as in the unramified leaf),
so `ρ_{g,λ}` is crystalline at `p`; but for `p ∥ M` the local
representation of a weight-2 newform at `p` is an unramified twist of
Steinberg — semistable non-crystalline (Deligne–Rapoport/Langlands,
Saito), and for `p² ∣ M` it is not even semistable. Hence `p ∤ M`.
The oddness of `p` keeps the flatness-to-crystalline dictionary in
its classical range (`e = 1 < p − 1`). SOUNDNESS AUDIT (2026-07-24):
non-vacuously satisfiable — any newform of level prime to `p` with
its stable lattice over `R = 𝒪_λ` realizes all hypotheses — and every

/-- **The conductor bound at `2`: a tame fixed line implies `4 ∤ M`**
(sorry node — Carayol's theorem at the place `2 ≠ p` combined with the
Artin conductor exponent formula): if the representation `τ` attached
(in the charpoly-matching sense) to the weight-2 newform `g` of level
`M` admits a surjective functional `π₂` whose kernel line is fixed
POINTWISE by the inertia at `2` (`hfix`) and on whose quotient the
inertia at `2` acts trivially (`hquot`), then `4 ∤ M`. Classical
proof: by rigidity `τ ≅ ρ_{g,λ} ⊗ ℚ̄_p` (Ribet irreducibility +
Chebotarev/Brauer–Nesbitt); transporting the hypotheses, the inertia
`I₂` acts on `ρ_{g,λ}` through unipotent upper-triangular matrices
with an `I₂`-pointwise-fixed line, so `dim V^{I₂} ≥ 1`, and the wild
inertia — a pro-2 group acting continuously and unipotently over a
field of residue characteristic `p ≠ 2` (its image is simultaneously
pro-2 as a continuous quotient and pro-`p` as a compact subgroup of
the unipotent group `≅ (ℚ̄_p, +)`) — acts trivially, so the Swan
conductor vanishes; the Artin exponent is
`a₂ = (2 − dim V^{I₂}) + Sw₂ ≤ 1`, and Carayol gives
`ord_2(M) = a₂ ≤ 1`. The inertia here is spelled over `Γ ℚ_[2]` via
`Z2bar` exactly as in `IsHardlyRamified.isTameAtTwo` (the PROVEN
bridge `localInertia_two_eq_map_padic` of `ModThree.lean` converts to
the adic-completion spelling up to conjugacy when needed). SOUNDNESS

/-- **Carayol's conductor bound on the hardly ramified class**
(DECOMPOSED 2026-07-24 into the per-place cut above and now a PROVEN
assembly): let `g` be a weight-2 newform of level `M` (the
minimal-level carrier), `τ` a representation matching its Hecke
polynomials away from a finite set (the attachment shape produced by
`exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform`), and suppose `τ` is
equivalent to the base change to `ℚ̄_p` of a HARDLY RAMIFIED integral
representation `ρ`. Then `M ∣ 2`. The assembly follows the classical
per-place conductor computation verbatim:

* at primes `q ∉ {2, p}`: `ρ` is unramified (`isUnramified`), the
  base-change instance and the PROVEN transport
  `isUnramifiedAt_of_linearEquiv` carry this through `e` to `τ`, and
  the Carayol leaf
  `weightTwoNewform_not_dvd_level_of_isUnramifiedAt` gives `q ∤ M`;
* at `p`: `ρ` is flat (`isFlat`), and the Saito/flatness leaf
  `weightTwoNewform_not_dvd_level_p_of_isFlatAt` gives `p ∤ M`;
* at `2`: the `isTameAtTwo` structure of `ρ` transports through `e`
  to `τ` (PROVEN here): the functional `π₂ := (lift of π) ∘ e` is
  surjective, inertia-equivariant with quotient character `δ` trivial
  on inertia, and its kernel line is fixed POINTWISE by the inertia
  at `2` — by the fixed-line criterion
  `end_apply_eq_self_of_det_one_of_comp_eq`, since
  `det τ = det ρ = χ_cyc` on inertia at `2` is `1` by the cyclotomic
  leaf `cyclotomicCharacter_eq_one_of_inertia_two` (odd `p`); the
  at-2 conductor leaf
  `weightTwoNewform_not_four_dvd_level_of_inertia_two` then gives
  `4 ∤ M`.

The endgame `M ∣ 2` is the PROVEN arithmetic
`dvd_two_of_forall_prime_eq_two` (every prime factor of `M` is `2`
since `p` is odd, and `4 ∤ M`). SOUNDNESS AUDIT (2026-07-24, carried
over): each per-place leaf is a non-vacuously satisfiable literature
statement (see the individual audits); the hypothesis-level
unsatisfiability that previous audits tracked (no irreducible hardly
ramified representation is modular — Wiles' final contradiction) is
no longer concentrated in any single leaf: the leaves are individually
true and satisfiable statements about newforms, and the collapse
lives, as it classically does, in the CONJUNCTION of the modularity
hypotheses upstream. -/

FOUNDER CUT of the section above and now a PROVEN assembly): if the
Frobenius traces of an irreducible hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation `ρ` arise (away from a finite set, in the `-a_q` trace
convention) from a weight-2 normalized eigenform `f` of some level
`N ≥ 1`, then they arise, in the same sense, from a weight-2
normalized eigenform of level `M` dividing `2`. The assembly follows
the classical route verbatim:

1. *Newform descent*
   (`exists_weightTwoNewform_of_weightTwoEigenform`, PROVEN): behind
   `f` lies a minimal-level eigenform `g` of level `M ∣ N` with the
   same eigensystem away from `N`; the `p`-adic embedding transports
   to its Hecke field (`exists_ringHom_heckeField_of_qCoeff_eq`,
   PROVEN).
2. *Attachment* (`exists_galoisRep_charFrob_of_weightTwoNewform`,
   sorry leaf): `g` has an attached 2-dimensional
   `ℚ̄_p`-representation `τ` with the Hecke characteristic
   polynomials at good primes (Eichler–Shimura).
3. *Rigidity* (`exists_linearEquiv_of_charFrob_eq`, PROVEN
   2026-07-24 — Chebotarev + char-0 Brauer–Nesbitt):
   `τ ≅ ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` — their Frobenius characteristic polynomials agree
   away from a finite set, because the trace matching `hmatch`
   upgrades to full charpoly matching through the determinant
   normalization (`charFrob_map_coeff_zero_of_isHardlyRamified`,
   PROVEN from `det = χ_cyc`) and the monic-quadratic shape, and
   `ρ ⊗ ℚ̄_p` is irreducible (`hirr`).
4. *Carayol's conductor bound*
   (`weightTwoNewform_level_dvd_two_of_isHardlyRamified`, since
   2026-07-24 itself a PROVEN per-place assembly over three conductor
   leaves and the cyclotomic-inertia leaf — see its docstring): the
   level of a newform whose attached representation is (through the
   rigidity equivalence) the base change of a hardly ramified
   representation divides `2` — Ribet's mod-`p` level lowering
   (Invent. Math. 100 (1990)) is the residual counterpart used when
   this content is reached through the Khare–Wintenberger induction
   instead.
5. The conclusion matches `ρ`'s traces with `g`'s coefficients
   through `κ` away from `S₁ ∪ {v : v ∣ N}` — bookkeeping, proven
   inline.

SOUNDNESS/DEPTH AUDIT (2026-07-24, carried over and sharpened): both
level-`M ∣ 2` spaces are proven empty in this file
(`weightTwoEigenform_level_one_false`,
`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`), so this theorem's conclusion is
unsatisfiable and it equivalently asserts that its hypotheses are
contradictory — that no irreducible hardly ramified `p`-adic
representation is modular of ANY level, which is exactly Wiles' final
contradiction. The previous audit predicted that a finer decomposition
must build the missing step 1–4 vocabulary rather than push the
contradiction out of this leaf; the section above does precisely
that. All remaining sorried leaves of this subtree — the attachment
and rigidity leaves here, and the per-place conductor leaves behind
the (now assembled) Carayol step — are non-vacuously satisfiable
literature statements; the hypothesis-level contradiction is no
longer concentrated in any single leaf but lives in the conjunction
of the modularity hypotheses, as it classically does (see the
Carayol assembly's audit). -/

/-- **The residually reducible branch** (pillar 4; DECOMPOSED
2026-07-24 into a PROVEN dichotomy on `p = 3` vs `p ≥ 5` — the AUDIT
of the consumers showed the general-odd-`p` statement is genuinely
needed, since `Family.lean`'s `mem_isCompatible` chain is instantiated
at every odd residue characteristic by `Lift.lean`, so no statement
narrowing is possible; instead the two instances are separated): a
hardly ramified `p`-adic representation that is irreducible over
`ℚ̄_p` but whose residual representation is REDUCIBLE is still
modular, in the same trace sense as pillar 3.

* At `p = 3` the hypotheses are contradictory: by the 3-adic
  classification (`Threeadic.lean`, through the helper
  `not_isIrreducible_baseChange_of_isHardlyRamified_three` above) a
  hardly ramified `3`-adic representation is a global extension of the
  trivial character by a character, hence never irreducible over
  `ℚ̄_3` — refuting `hirr`.
* At `p ≥ 5` the statement is the genuine Skinner–Wiles/Pan content,
  delegated to the sorried leaf
  `exists_weightTwoEigenform_trace_eq_of_residually_reducible_of_five_le`

/-- **Level optimization to `Γ₀(2)`** (pillar 5; PROVEN 2026-07-24 as
an assembly over the sorried conductor leaf
`exists_eigenform_level_dvd_two_of_trace_eq` just above, which now
carries the Carayol-conductor/Ribet content, plus the proven emptiness
of both level-`M ∣ 2` eigenform carriers —
`weightTwoEigenform_level_one_false`,
`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`; the eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)`
conclusion follows from the resulting contradiction): if the
eigensystem `(E, S, Pv)` of an
irreducible hardly ramified `p`-adic representation `ρ` arises, in the
trace convention of the pillars above, from a weight-2 eigenform `f`
of SOME level `N ≥ 1`, then it arises from a weight-2 eigenform of
level `Γ₀(2)` exactly, matching `Pv` in the `MatchesEigensystem`
sense. Classical route: the coefficient characterization
(`IsWeightTwoEigenform`, Diamond–Shurman Prop. 5.8.5) places behind
`f` a newform `g` of level `M ∣ N` with the same good-prime
eigensystem (D–S Prop. 5.8.4, strong multiplicity one); `ρ` and the
`λ`-adic representation of `g` agree on Frobenius traces, and the
Artin conductor of a hardly ramified representation divides `2`
(unramified outside `2p`; flatness at `p` kills the `p`-part; the
tame rank-1 unramified quotient at `2` bounds the conductor exponent
at `2` by `1`), so Carayol's theorem (*Sur les représentations
`ℓ`-adiques associées aux formes modulaires de Hilbert*, Ann. Sci.
ÉNS 19 (1986); Livné for the residual cases — "level of the newform =
conductor of the representation") forces `M ∣ 2`, and a newform of
level `M ∣ 2` is a normalized eigenform of `S₂(Γ₀(2))` (oldform
inclusion when `M = 1`). Mod-`p` level lowering (Ribet, *On modular
representations of `Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)` arising from modular forms*, Invent.
Math. 100 (1990); Serre, Duke 1987, §4.1) is the residual counterpart
used when this content is instead reached through the
Khare–Wintenberger induction. Soundness under the collapse
(2026-07-24): `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` is proven above
(`weightTwoEigenform_level_two_false`), so this pillar equivalently
asserts that its hypotheses are contradictory — that an irreducible
hardly ramified `p`-adic representation is never modular of any level
— which is the true classical content (Wiles' final contradiction),
derived in the literature exactly along the route just cited. -/

serves — level lowering is NOT consumed here, only by the level-2
