# The Khare–Wintenberger cut behind residual modularity at `ℓ ≥ 5`

This module carries the founder decomposition of the residual-modularity
leaf `exists_weightTwoEigenform_residual_of_isIrreducible_of_five_le`
(`Modularity/Interface.lean`, pillar 2 at `ℓ ≥ 5` — the
Khare–Wintenberger content of the modularity subtree).

## Route choice (AUDIT, 2026-07-24)

Two literature routes were audited for that leaf:

* the **Khare–Wintenberger induction** (*Serre's modularity conjecture
  (I), (II)*, Invent. Math. 178 (2009)): minimal lifting of the residual
  representation to a strictly compatible system, then induction on the
  residue characteristic with modularity switching at auxiliary primes;
* the **potential-modularity chain** of the FLT blueprint (ch. 4:
  Moret–Bailly, dihedral residual modularity from converse theorems,
  modularity lifting over totally real fields, base-change descent) —
  the route the reference Lean project (`~/cs/FLT`) chose.

For the HARDLY RAMIFIED type both routes converge onto the same terminal
shape. Any compatible system attached to a hardly ramified
representation has a `3`-adic member which is hardly ramified `3`-adic,
and this project PROVES (Fontaine/Odlyzko discriminant bounds,
`ModThree.lean`; ordinarity lifting, `Threeadic.lean`) that such a
member is a global extension of the trivial character by the cyclotomic
character — its Frobenius traces are `1 + q`. So the anchor-prime step
of either route does not produce a cusp form: it produces the Eisenstein
trace system, and transporting it back through the family forces the
residual representation to be REDUCIBLE (Chebotarev + Brauer–Nesbitt),
contradicting the leaf's irreducibility hypothesis. Both classical
routes, instantiated at this type, are therefore proofs by contradiction
— which is exactly the blueprint's plan (ch. 4, "Compatible families,
and reduction at 3") and exactly why `S₂(Γ₀(2)) = 0` makes Serre's
conjecture at type `(2, 2)` a nonexistence theorem. The sound cut is
hence the blueprint cut: prove the headline

  **no irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ` representation exists for
  `ℓ ≥ 5`** (`not_isIrreducible_of_isHardlyRamified_of_five_le`)

and discharge the interface leaf by `absurd`. The alternative — a
non-vacuous eigenform-producing decomposition — would require
constructing analytic cusp forms (Langlands–Tunnell / converse-theorem
machinery) on a pin with no Hecke theory; that route is strictly deeper
at every node and was rejected.

## Relation to the existing tree (NO CYCLE, NO SILENT DUPLICATION)

The tree already contains this chain ONCE: `Reducible.lean`'s B5 is
proven from `Lift.lean`'s `exists_hardlyRamifiedLift` (B6a),
`residual_charFrob_eq` (B6bc) and `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq`
(Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt). But B6bc routes through `Family.lean`'s
`mem_isCompatible`, whose proof consumes the modularity interface — the
very assemblies that consume the leaf this module discharges. Importing
`Lift.lean` here would therefore close the dependency cycle that the
interface's CIRCULARITY GUARD forbids. The three pillars below (α
PROVEN 2026-07-24 by the proof-sharing refactor; β and γ sorried)
are consequently FAMILY-FREE restatements, and their docstrings record,
pillar by pillar, which in-tree twin they mirror and which discharge
routes are sound:

* pillar α (`exists_hardlyRamified_lift_residual_of_five_le`) mirrors
  `Lift.lean`'s B6a and — since the 2026-07-24 proof-sharing refactor —
  IS PROVEN by delegation to the shared Family-free module
  `HardlyRamified/Deformation.lean` (the deformation development moved
  out of `Lift.lean` and generalized over the coefficient field `k`;
  both this pillar and B6a now consume the same
  `exists_hardlyRamified_lift_of_five_le`);
* pillar β (`exists_threeadic_compatible_member_of_five_le`) mirrors
  B6b + the 3-adic specialization, but its in-tree twin's proof
  (through `Family.lean`) is UNSOUND here — its only sound discharge is
  the potential-modularity construction. This pillar is where the
  genuine depth of the residual-modularity leaf now lives;
* pillar γ (`not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eisenstein`) is the
  finite-coefficient-field transfer of the PROVEN
  `not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq`, whose proof consumes only
  Family-free material from `Chebotarev.lean` — a mechanical
  generalization, no new mathematics.

The assembly `not_isIrreducible_of_isHardlyRamified_of_five_le` is
PROVEN below from the three pillars plus the PROVEN 3-adic machinery
(`IsHardlyRamified.exists_frobenius_triangular`, `Threeadic.lean` — the
trace form of the same classification is B6c,
`IsHardlyRamified.three_adic`).

(Import note, 2026-07-24: `Chebotarev.lean` — the home of pillar γ's
proof ingredients — is deliberately NOT imported: the assembly does not
need it, thanks to the triangular-Frobenius route through
`Threeadic.lean`; the agent proving pillar γ adds the import then.)

/-- **Pillar α — Khare–Wintenberger minimal lifting** (sorry node): an
IRREDUCIBLE hardly ramified mod-`ℓ` representation, `ℓ ≥ 5`, lifts to a
hardly ramified `ℓ`-adic representation: a characteristic-zero
coefficient package `O` — a local domain, module-finite over `ℤ_ℓ` with
its module topology and `ℤ_ℓ ↪ O` (classically: the image of the
universal hardly ramified deformation ring in a `ℚ̄_ℓ`-point, a subring
of the integers of a finite extension of `ℚ_ℓ`; taking the image rather
than the full valuation ring is what makes the residue field exactly
`k`, so that the reduction `π` below exists onto `k` itself) — carrying
a hardly ramified representation on `Fin 2 → O` whose Frobenius
characteristic polynomials reduce through a surjection `π : O →+* k` to
those of `ρbar` at every prime `q ∉ {2, ℓ}`.

Literature: Khare–Wintenberger, *Serre's modularity conjecture (I)*,
Invent. Math. 178 (2009), Theorem 4.1 and §4 (existence of minimal
`p`-adic lifts of prescribed type — here Serre type `(2, 2)`, i.e. the
hardly ramified conditions: cyclotomic determinant, unramified outside
`2ℓ`, flat at `ℓ`, tame square-trivial rank-1 quotient at `2`). The
proof machinery is Kisin's flat deformation theory (*Moduli of finite
flat group schemes, and modularity*, Ann. of Math. 170 (2009)), Böckle's
presentation bounds for global deformation rings, and Taylor's potential
modularity (*Remarks on a conjecture of Fontaine and Mazur*, J. Inst.
Math. Jussieu 1 (2002); *On the meromorphic continuation of degree two
L-functions*, Doc. Math. Extra Vol. (2006)) supplying the finiteness
input that forces the deformation ring to have a characteristic-zero
point. FLT blueprint ch. 4: "use Khare–Wintenberger to lift `ρ` to a
potentially modular `ℓ`-adic Galois representation of conductor 2".

SOUNDNESS AUDIT (both ways, 2026-07-24): (i) direct — this is KW
Theorem 4.1 specialized to type `(2, 2)`, a true nonvacuous theorem of
deformation theory (its proof nowhere presupposes that the target
spaces of Serre's conjecture are nonzero); (ii) collapse — the
hypothesis set (an irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ` representation,
`ℓ ≥ 5`) is classically unsatisfiable (the headline theorem below), so
the statement is also vacuously sound; no honest weakening of the
conclusion can make the hypotheses satisfiable.

DISCHARGED (2026-07-24) BY THE ANTICIPATED PROOF-SHARING REFACTOR: the
deformation development formerly inlined in `Lift.lean` was audited
(it consumes nothing from `Family.lean`), extracted into the
Family-free module `HardlyRamified/Deformation.lean`, and generalized
from `ZMod ℓ` to the finite coefficient field `k`; this pillar is now
the verbatim application of its terminal theorem
`exists_hardlyRamified_lift_of_five_le`, and `Lift.lean`'s
`exists_hardlyRamifiedLift` (the in-tree twin, B6a) is the
instantiation of the SAME theorem at `k = ZMod ℓ` — one development,
two consumers, no cycle. The remaining depth lives in the shared
sorried leaves of `Deformation.lean` (Mazur representability, Carayol
subring descent, Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt conjugacy, mod-`ℓ`
finiteness, minimal `W(k)`-presentations, Böckle relation bound).

/-- **Pillar β — the compatible system and its `3`-adic member** (sorry
node — the potential-modularity content, and the genuine depth of the
residual-modularity leaf): a hardly ramified `ℓ`-adic lift (as produced
by pillar α) of an irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ` representation,
`ℓ ≥ 5`, lies in a compatible system: there are a number field `E`, a
family `Pv` of `E`-coefficient polynomials indexed by the places of `ℚ`,
and embeddings identifying `Pv` at almost all places both with the
Frobenius characteristic polynomials of `ρ` (through `ψℓ`, `ιO` into
`ℚ̄_ℓ`) and with those of a hardly ramified `3`-ADIC representation `τ`
(through `ψ₃`, `ιA` into `ℚ̄_3`) over a coefficient package `A` of the
same characteristic-zero shape — in particular `ℤ_3`-FREE, as the
integers of a finite extension of `ℚ_3` are, which is what the proven
`3`-adic classification consumes.

Classically the `3`-adic member is hardly ramified because strict
compatibility transports the type: the conductor divides `2` and the
determinant is cyclotomic across the family; flatness at `3` holds by
Fontaine–Laffaille theory (weight 2, `3` prime to the conductor); the
tame unramified square-trivial rank-1 quotient at `2` is the fixed
Weil–Deligne type at `2`.

Literature: Khare–Wintenberger, *Serre's modularity conjecture (I)*,
Invent. Math. 178 (2009), §5 (the lift is part of a strictly compatible
system — via potential modularity and Brauer's theorem, following
Dieulefait and Taylor); Barnet-Lamb–Gee–Geraghty–Taylor, *Potential
automorphy and change of weight*, Ann. of Math. 179 (2014), §5 (the
Brauer-trick construction of compatible systems attached to potentially
automorphic representations); Taylor, *Remarks on a conjecture of
Fontaine and Mazur*, J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 1 (2002) (potential
modularity via Moret–Bailly). FLT blueprint ch. 4: "put it into an
`ℓ`-adic family using the Brauer's theorem trick … and look at the
`3`-adic specialisation".

SOUNDNESS AUDIT (both ways, 2026-07-24): (i) direct — for the intended
instantiation (pillar α's package, the KW minimal lift) this is KW (I)
§5 verbatim; for an abstract package `(O, ρ, π)` not arising from that
construction the literature statement does not directly apply
(abstract-quantification caveat, same as the interface's pillar 3b),
but (ii) collapse — the hypothesis set includes an irreducible hardly
ramified mod-`ℓ` representation with `ℓ ≥ 5`, classically unsatisfiable
(headline below), so the statement is classically true for every
package.

CIRCULARITY GUARD (load-bearing, stronger than the usual note): the
in-tree twin of this pillar is `Family.lean`'s `mem_isCompatible`
composed with `Lift.lean`'s `residual_charFrob_eq_of_family` — but
`mem_isCompatible` is proven THROUGH the modularity interface (the
compatible family is extracted from the eigenform attached by the
interface's assemblies), i.e. through the consumer of the leaf this
module discharges. Porting that proof here would close the cycle. The
ONLY sound discharges of this pillar are the genuinely independent
constructions: KW (I) §5, or the blueprint's potential-modularity chain
(Moret–Bailly + dihedral residual modularity + modularity lifting over
totally real fields + base-change descent). Future dispatches on this
node must build that machinery, not reuse `Family.lean`. -/

/-- **Pillar γ — Chebotarev + Brauer–Nesbitt over a finite coefficient
field** (sorry node — mechanical transfer, no new mathematics): a
continuous mod-`ℓ` representation over a finite coefficient field `k`
whose Frobenius characteristic polynomials away from a finite set of
places are those of `1 ⊕ χ̄_cyc` — the Eisenstein quadratic
`X² − (q+1)X + q` at `Frob_q` — is not irreducible.

This is the finite-coefficient-field form of the PROVEN
`GaloisRepresentation.not_isIrreducible_of_charFrob_eq` (`Lift.lean`,
stated over `ZMod ℓ`), whose proof consumes ONLY Family-free material,
all of it in `Chebotarev.lean` (already imported here):
`dense_conjClasses_globalFrob` (Frobenii are dense in conjugates, the
Chebotarev node), `continuous_cyclotomicCharacterModL`,
`cyclotomicCharacterModL_globalFrob`, `discreteTopology_moduleTopology`,
the quadratic coefficient lemmas, and the pointwise Brauer–Nesbitt node
`not_isIrreducible_of_charpoly_eq` (Kolchin/common-eigenvector route,
`BrauerNesbitt.lean`). The `Lift.lean` home of the twin — not its
ingredients — is what blocks a direct import (the `Family.lean` cycle);
the prover of this pillar should `import
Fermat.FLT.GaloisRepresentation.Chebotarev` (Family-free) and follow
the twin's proof.

Generalization path for the eventual proof: `char k = ℓ` (the kernel of
`ℤ_ℓ → k` is a nonzero prime, hence the maximal ideal, since `k` is
finite), so `ZMod ℓ` maps canonically into `k` (`ZMod.castHom`); replace
the `ZMod ℓ`-valued comparison functions of the twin's density argument
by their `k`-valued composites (continuity is free — `k` is discrete),
and rerun the Kolchin argument, whose two `BrauerNesbitt` inputs are
field-generic. Literature: Serre, *Abelian ℓ-adic representations and
elliptic curves*, I-2.3 (density determines the semisimplification);
Curtis–Reiner, *Methods of Representation Theory*, §30 (Brauer–Nesbitt).

SOUNDNESS AUDIT (both ways, 2026-07-24): (i) direct — a true,
NON-vacuous statement (the split representation `1 ⊕ χ̄_cyc` itself

/-- **The headline: no irreducible hardly ramified mod-`ℓ`
representation for `ℓ ≥ 5`** (PROVEN 2026-07-24 as an assembly over the
three pillars above and the PROVEN `3`-adic machinery) — the FLT
blueprint's ch. 4 reduction target ("there is no prime `ℓ ≥ 5` and
hardly-ramified irreducible 2-dimensional Galois representation"),
stated over a general finite coefficient field.

Assembly: lift `ρbar` (pillar α), spread the lift into a compatible
system with a hardly ramified `3`-adic member `τ` (pillar β); by the
PROVEN classification (`IsHardlyRamified.exists_frobenius_triangular`,
`Threeadic.lean`: in some basis the local Frobenius at `q ≥ 5` acts by
`[[q, *], [0, 1]]`), the member's Frobenius characteristic polynomials
are the Eisenstein quadratics `X² − (q+1)X + q`
(`LinearMap.charpoly_toMatrix` + `Matrix.charpoly_fin_two`); the
`E`-linkage transports them back — `ψ₃` is injective (a ring
homomorphism out of the field `E`), so the family polynomials `Pv` are
Eisenstein over `E`; `ιO` is injective, so the lift's characteristic
polynomials are Eisenstein over `O`; the reduction `π` carries them to
`ρbar` — whence `ρbar` is reducible by Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt
(pillar γ), refuting irreducibility.

Relation to `Reducible.lean`'s B5 (`not_isIrreducible_of_isHardlyRamified`,
same statement over `ZMod ℓ`): B5 is the TREE's consumer node and its
route runs through `Family.lean`'s compatible-family machinery, which
consumes the modularity interface; this assembly is the Family-free
copy of the same argument, existing precisely so that the interface's
residual-modularity leaf can be discharged without a cycle. The two
routes share their proven 3-adic and Chebotarev ingredients and are
intended to share the lifting proof after the `Lift.lean` refactor
described on pillar α. -/
