# Multiplication by `n` on an abelian scheme, as a morphism, and its surjectivity

This module sits between `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean` (which gives an
abelian scheme only through its functor of points) and
`Modularity/TateModule.lean` (which consumes divisibility of a geometric
fibre).  It supplies the object that statement is really about — the
MORPHISM `[n] : A ⟶ A` — and reduces

  `exists_nsmul_eq_geomFibrePt` (`A_x̄(F̄)` is `n`-divisible)

to a single statement of the theory of abelian varieties which mentions
no Galois action, no field, and no group of points:

  `flat_locallyOfFinitePresentation_mulByNat` — `[n]` is FLAT and of
  finite presentation, i.e. (with the already-free properness) `[n]` is
  finite locally free.  That is the output of the THEOREM OF THE CUBE.

## Why a separate module

The Yoneda layer below (`RelPoint.self` … `isProper_mulByNat`) previously
lived inside `Modularity/TateModule.lean`, *below* the divisibility leaf
it is needed to prove.  Lean's declaration order therefore made the leaf
unprovable where it stands.  Moving the layer into an upstream module —
rather than reordering a 5000-line file whose other leaves have their own
owners — is the minimal fix, and it also cuts the layer's elaboration out
of that file.  The declarations are moved VERBATIM and keep their names,
so every existing consumer resolves unchanged through the `public import`.

## The reduction, in full

Everything here except the one leaf is PROVEN.  The chain is:

1. **Yoneda.** `mulByNat n : A ⟶ A` is the `n`-fold sum of the
   tautological point `𝟙 A`, and `nsmul_val` says precomposition with it
   computes `n • y` on every relative point.  Hence "`∃ w, n • w = y`" is
   literally "`y.1` factors through `[n]`" (`exists_nsmul_of_exists_comp`).
2. **For free from `ab`.** `[n] ≫ f = f`, so `[n]` is PROPER
   (`isProper_mulByNat`, via `IsProper.of_comp`) and LOCALLY OF FINITE
   TYPE (`locallyOfFiniteType_mulByNat`, via `locallyOfFiniteType_of_comp`).
   Neither uses any abelian-variety input.
3. **The leaf.** `[n]` is flat and locally of finite presentation.
4. **`[n]` is UNIVERSALLY OPEN** (`universallyOpen_mulByNat`), by
   `UniversallyOpen.of_flat`.
5. **`[n]` is SURJECTIVE** (`surjective_mulByNat`).  Its image is open by
   (4) and closed by (2), hence clopen; it meets every fibre of `f`
   because `[n]` fixes the zero section (`zeroSection_comp_mulByNat`); and
   the fibres of `f` are CONNECTED (`ab.connected`).  A clopen set meeting
   a connected set contains it, so the image is everything.  **This is the
   only place `ab.connected` is used, and it is essential**: for a
   disconnected group scheme `[n]` need not be surjective.
6. **`F̄`-points lift** (`exists_comp_eq_of_surjective`).  Base-change `[n]`
   along the point; the pullback is surjective onto `Spec F̄` hence
   nonempty, and locally of finite type over a field, hence a Jacobson
   space; a closed point of it has residue field `F̄` because `F̄` is
   algebraically closed, giving a section.  This is the Nullstellensatz
   step, and it is general scheme theory — no abelian varieties in it.

Step 6 is why the leaf may be stated about the morphism rather than about
points: the passage from "surjective as a map of schemes" to "surjective
on `F̄`-points" is proven here once and for all.

if `f ≫ g` is locally of finite presentation and `g` is locally of finite
TYPE, then `f` is locally of finite presentation.  Stacks 0562/01TS.

This is general scheme theory with no abelian-variety content, and it is a
gap in mathlib at this pin: `LocallyOfFiniteType` has
`locallyOfFiniteType_of_comp` and `LocallyQuasiFinite` has
`LocallyQuasiFinite.of_comp`, both via `HasRingHomProperty.of_comp`, but
`LocallyOfFinitePresentation` has neither — and it cannot use
`HasRingHomProperty.of_comp` as it stands, because that helper's
hypothesis `Q (g ∘ f) → Q g` admits no side condition, whereas the ring
statement `RingHom.FinitePresentation.of_comp_finiteType` genuinely needs
`f` of finite type.  (It must: `LocallyOfFinitePresentation` is not
cancellable outright.  A closed immersion `Spec (R/I) ⟶ Spec R` with `I`
not finitely generated is not locally of finite presentation, while its
composite with `Spec R ⟶ Spec (R/I)`'s base need not see that.)

So the proof re-runs `HasRingHomProperty.of_comp`'s four-step reduction —
affine target, affine middle, affine source, then the ring statement —
carrying the auxiliary hypothesis through each step.  `LocallyOfFiniteType`
is Zariski-local at source and target, which is exactly what makes the
extra hypothesis survive the restrictions. -/

/-! ### The theorem of the cube, in its minimal usable form -/

/-- **Multiplication by a nonzero `n` on an abelian scheme is FLAT**
(sorry leaf — abelian varieties; Mumford *Abelian Varieties* §6
(Application 2 of the theorem of the cube) and §18, Milne *Abelian
Varieties* I.7, Silverman *AEC* III.6).

**This is now the WHOLE of the flatness half of the cube input.**  The
leaf that used to stand here asked for `Flat ∧ LocallyOfFinitePresentation`;
the second conjunct was discharged on 2026-07-26 by
`locallyOfFinitePresentation_mulByNat` above, which is free from
`[n] ≫ f = f` and the smoothness of `f`.  So the abelian-variety content
has been isolated to the single word `Flat`.

Together with `isProper_mulByNat` and `locallyOfFinitePresentation_mulByNat`
(both free) this says `[n]` is **finite locally free**, of degree `n^{2g}`
on each fibre of `f` — the classical statement that `[n]` is an isogeny.
Only the flatness is asked for here, because properness and finite
presentation are already available without any abelian-variety input.

**Entry point for a prover.**  `AlgebraicGeometry.Flat.of_stalkMap`
reduces this to: for every `x : A` the induced map of local rings
`𝒪_{A, [n] x} ⟶ 𝒪_{A, x}` is flat.  That is where a miracle-flatness
argument would be applied — and note that mathlib at this pin has **no**
Cohen–Macaulay theory and **no** notion of the dimension of a scheme, so
miracle flatness has to be built before it can be used.

**The argument.** Fibrewise over `S`, fix a geometric fibre `A_s` of
dimension `g` and a symmetric ample line bundle `L` on it.  The theorem of
the cube gives `[n]^* L ≅ L^{n²}`, which is again ample for `n ≠ 0`; a
morphism pulling an ample bundle back to an ample bundle has finite
fibres, so `[n]` is quasi-finite, and being also proper it is finite.
`A_s` is smooth over a field, hence regular, and a finite morphism between
regular schemes of the same dimension with finite fibres is flat
("miracle flatness"); a finite flat algebra is of finite presentation.

**`hn` is LOAD-BEARING.**  `mulByNat 0 = f ≫ zeroSection` factors through
the base, so for `g ≥ 1` it is not flat: its fibre over a point of the
zero section is a whole fibre of `f`, of dimension `g`, while its fibre
over any other point is empty.  Flatness would force those to have the
same dimension.

**Relation to the sibling leaf.**  `Modularity/TateModule.lean` carries
`locallyQuasiFinite_mulByNat`, which asks for the QUASI-FINITENESS of the
same morphism and is the same theorem-of-the-cube input; over it that file
derives `IsFinite (mulByNat n)` by Zariski's main theorem.  The two leaves
are deliberately *not* merged: quasi-finiteness is what the torsion
CARDINALITY arguments need, flatness is what DIVISIBILITY needs, and a
prover who has the cube gets both at once.  Neither consumes the other.

**MISSING MACHINERY at this pin** (surveyed 2026-07-26).  Mathlib has
group schemes as `GrpObj` objects of `Over (Spec K)`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Group/{Abelian,Smooth}.lean`), `Flat`,
`LocallyOfFinitePresentation` and `UniversallyOpen.of_flat`.  It has **no**
`AbelianVariety`, no isogeny theory, no `[n]`, no theorem of the cube, no
degree, no ample line bundles (the only `Ample` in mathlib is
`Analysis/Convex/AmpleSet.lean`), no Picard scheme or functor, and no
notion of the dimension of a scheme or of the fibres of a morphism —
`SmoothOfRelativeDimension n` carries `n` as an opaque index with no lemma
tying it to any dimension.  Supplying an isogeny package is what this leaf
asks for.

Note that this leaf does **not** need dimension theory to be STATED, which
is the point of cutting here: the dimension count lives inside its proof,
not in its statement, and the two consequences that the rest of this module
draws from it — universal openness and then surjectivity — are pure
topology over the already-available properness and connectedness. -/

    Flat (ab.mulByNat n) :=
  sorry

/-- **The fibres of `[n]` are FINITE** (sorry leaf — abelian varieties;
same references as `flat_mulByNat`).

This is the SECOND cube input, and it is the one the torsion CARDINALITY
arguments need.  It says exactly that `ker[n]` is a finite group scheme:
the fibre of `[n]` over a point `a` is a torsor under the kernel taken in
the fibre of `f` through `a`, so all the fibres are finite as soon as one
of them is.

**Why it is stated on point-set fibres rather than as `LocallyQuasiFinite`.**
Its consumer, `locallyQuasiFinite_mulByNat` in `Modularity/TateModule.lean`,
used to BE the leaf.  But `LocallyQuasiFinite` is (locally of finite type)
+ (quasi-finite fibres), and the first half is already free here
(`locallyOfFiniteType_mulByNat`), so the old leaf was redundantly asking a
prover for something already proven.  Mathlib's
`LocallyQuasiFinite.of_finite_preimage_singleton` needs only
`[LocallyOfFiniteType]` plus this statement, so this is the exact residue.

**Independent of `flat_mulByNat`.**  Neither leaf implies the other at this
pin: flatness would follow from finite fibres only via miracle flatness
(absent — no Cohen–Macaulay theory, no scheme dimension), and finite fibres
do not follow from flatness at all (`f` itself is flat with positive
dimensional fibres).  Both are outputs of the theorem of the cube, and a
prover who has the cube discharges both at once. -/

/-- **`[n]` is SURJECTIVE** (PROVEN over the leaf).

The image of `[n]` is OPEN because `[n]` is universally open, and CLOSED
because `[n]` is proper — and properness is free, so the leaf supplies
only the openness.  So the image is a clopen subset of `A`.

`A` itself need not be connected, so the argument is fibrewise: given
`a : A`, the fibre `f ⁻¹' {f a}` is CONNECTED (`ab.connected`, through
`Scheme.Hom.isConnected_preimage_singleton`), and it meets the image
because `[n]` fixes the zero section, whose value at `f a` lies in that
fibre.  A connected set meeting a clopen set is contained in it
(`IsPreconnected.subset_isClopen`), so `a` is in the image.

This is the only use of `ab.connected` in the divisibility chain, and it
cannot be dropped: on a disconnected commutative group scheme — say the
constant group scheme `ℤ/n` over a field — `[n]` is the zero map and is
very far from surjective. -/

/-- **A `K`-point lifts along a surjective morphism locally of finite
type, `K` algebraically closed** (PROVEN 2026-07-26).

This is the Nullstellensatz step, and it contains no abelian-variety
input at all — it is general scheme theory and would be at home in
mathlib.

Given `w : Spec K ⟶ Y`, base-change `φ` along `w`.  Surjectivity of `φ`
gives `Set.range (pullback.snd φ w) = w ⁻¹' Set.range φ = univ`
(`Scheme.Pullback.range_snd`), so `pullback.snd` is surjective and in
particular `pullback φ w` is NONEMPTY.  It is locally of finite type over
`Spec K`, and `K` is a field hence a Jacobson ring, so the pullback is a
JACOBSON SPACE and therefore has a closed point
(`nonempty_inter_closedPoints`).  Because `K` is algebraically closed, the
residue field at a closed point of a `K`-scheme locally of finite type is
`K` itself, so that closed point IS a `K`-point
(`AlgebraicGeometry.pointOfClosedPoint`), i.e. a section of
`pullback.snd`.  Composing it with `pullback.fst` and using
`pullback.condition` gives the required factorization.

Note what is NOT needed: no finiteness of `φ`, no flatness, no

/-- **Every `F̄`-point of `A` is `[n]` of another one** (PROVEN over the
single leaf `flat_locallyOfFinitePresentation_mulByNat`).

This is the scheme-level form of divisibility, and it is what
`exists_nsmul_eq_geomFibrePt` consumes.  Note that no compatibility with
the base is imposed on `w` or asserted of `u`: `u ≫ [n] = w` forces
`u ≫ f = w ≫ f` automatically, so the statement is about `A` alone. -/
