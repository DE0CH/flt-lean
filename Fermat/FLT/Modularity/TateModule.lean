# Tate modules of a geometric fibre of an abelian scheme

This module supplies the **second missing piece** of the classical
discharge of `exists_twistedHilbertBlumenthalModuli_of_five_le`
(`Modularity/KhareWintenberger.lean`), continuing
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`. That module made the *torsion* of a
geometric fibre a `Γ_F`-module; this one makes the *Tate module* — the
inverse limit of the torsion along a uniformizer — an object the pin can
name, and cuts the Tate-module construction

  `nonempty_hilbertBlumenthalPoint_of_isTwistedHilbertBlumenthalModuli`

into two independently citable statements of the theory of abelian
varieties:

* `exists_tateFrame_of_levelStructure` — items 7 and 8 of that leaf's
  missing-machinery list: `T_I A` is free of rank `2` over the
  completion `𝒪_{D,I}`, with continuous `Γ_F`-action, and its reduction
  is `A[I]`, so the Frobenius characteristic polynomials of `T_I A`
  reduce to those of the level structure;
* `exists_weilFrobeniusSystem_of_mult` — item 9, Weil/Faltings: those
  characteristic polynomials are already defined over `D` and are
  INDEPENDENT of `I`, i.e. the `T_I A` for varying `I` are members of one
  strictly compatible system. This is the deepest statement in the
  chain.

## Why a DEFINITION is needed here, and what it buys

The two statements above cannot be cut apart without an object that ties
them together. Each of them is an existence statement about a coefficient
ring `O` and a representation `τ : Γ_F → GL₂(O)`; but "there exists a
rank-`2` representation whose reduction is `A[I]`" and "there exists a
`D`-rational compatible system" are, taken separately, statements about
*unrelated* representations — the second is outright FALSE when applied
to an arbitrary `τ` that merely happens to have the right reduction,
since a residual condition constrains `τ` only modulo `I`. Any cut into
two leaves must therefore name the actual Tate module.

`TatePt` is that name. It is the honest inverse limit

  `T = lim ( ⋯ →  A[I³]  --·π-->  A[I²]  --·π-->  A[I] )`,

taken inside the `Γ_F`-module of geometric points supplied by
`Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`, with the transition maps given by
multiplication by an element `π ∈ I ∖ I²` (which generates `I` in the
local ring `𝒪_{D,I}`, so the limit is the usual `I`-adic Tate module and
not a product over several primes). No completion, no topology and no
profinite machinery is needed to WRITE it: it is a subtype of
`ℕ → GeomFibrePt f x` cut out by two equations, exactly as
`Mult.torsion` is a subset cut out by one.

Both leaves below then speak about `TatePt`: the first produces a FRAME
— a `Γ_F`-equivariant additive bijection `(Fin 2 → O) ≃ T` — and the
second consumes one. That is the link, and it is what makes the second
leaf a true statement rather than a plausible-looking false one.

## What is proven here

Nothing. This module contains exactly one definition and two sorried
leaves; its content is the cut. The definition carries no axioms of its
own, so the leaves are statements about the geometric objects of
`AbelianScheme.lean` and about nothing else.

/-! ### The Tate module of a geometric fibre -/

/-- **The `I`-adic Tate module of the geometric fibre of `f : A ⟶ S` at
an `F`-point `x`**, for an ideal `I` of the coefficient ring `R` acting
on `A` and an element `π ∈ I`:

  `T = lim_n A[Iⁿ]`, the transition maps being multiplication by `π`.

Concretely a point of `T` is a sequence `y : ℕ → A(F̄)` with `y n`
killed by `Iⁿ` and `π · y (n+1) = y n`. The zeroth stage is trivial —
`I⁰ = ⊤` contains `1`, so `A[I⁰] = 0` and hence `y 0 = 0` — which is the
usual indexing of the limit.

The intended `π` is an element of `I ∖ I²` for `I` maximal in the ring
of integers of a number field, so that `I` becomes principal generated
by `π` in the local ring `R_I` and the limit above is the classical
`I`-adic Tate module. Leaves stating properties of `TatePt` therefore
carry `π ∈ I` and `π ∉ I ^ 2` as hypotheses; with a `π` violating them
(most brutally `π = 0`, which forces `T = 0`) the object is not the Tate
module and no rank-`2` frame exists — which is exactly why the frame is
what the leaves below quantify over.

The Galois action is the one induced from
`Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct.galSMul` componentwise, and the additive
structure the one induced from `Fermat.AbelianSchemeStruct.add`
componentwise; both are written out explicitly in the statements below
rather than installed as instances, in the same style as the level
structures of `IsTwistedHilbertBlumenthalModuli`, so that nothing has to
be carried through the `letI` of `AbelianSchemeStruct.addCommGroup`. -/

/-! ### The two leaves of the Tate-module construction -/

/-- **Tate modules are free of rank two, and reduce to the torsion**
(sorry node — items 7 and 8 of the Tate-module construction; Silverman
*AEC* III.7 and *ATAEC* for the elliptic case, Mumford *Abelian
Varieties* §18 in general, Taylor 2002 §2 for the Hilbert–Blumenthal
normalization).

Let `A ⟶ S` be an abelian scheme with a multiplication by the ring of
integers of a totally real field `D` whose degree equals the relative
dimension — a Hilbert–Blumenthal family — and let `x` be an `F`-point.
Let `I` be a maximal ideal of `𝒪_D` over the rational prime `q`, and
suppose the `I`-torsion of the geometric fibre at `x` is identified, as a
`Γ_F`-module, with a two-dimensional representation `ρ'` over a finite
field `k'` (this is precisely the shape of a level structure of
`IsTwistedHilbertBlumenthalModuli`).

Then there are an element `π ∈ I ∖ I²`, a coefficient ring `O`
(classically the completion `𝒪_{D,I}`: a local ring, finite free over
`ℤ_q`, with its module topology) and a continuous representation
`τ : Γ_F → GL₂(O)` which **frames** the Tate module `TatePt m x I π`:
an additive, `Γ_F`-equivariant bijection `(Fin 2 → O) ≃ T`. Moreover the
reduction `O →+* k'` carries the Frobenius characteristic polynomials of
`τ` onto those of `ρ'`.

Two remarks on the statement.

* The residual clause holds at EVERY place `w`, not merely outside a bad
  set: it expresses an isomorphism `T / I·T ≅ A[I]` of `Γ_F`-modules,
  and isomorphic representations have equal characteristic polynomials
  at every group element. The finite bad set of the compatible system
  enters only through `exists_weilFrobeniusSystem_of_mult`.
* The reduction map `ι₀` is EXISTENTIALLY quantified rather than being
  "the" residue map. This is not slack: the level structure `e` is only
  an isomorphism of `Γ_F`-modules, so the `k'`-structure of `ρ'` and the
  `𝒪_D/I`-structure transported from `A[I]` are two embeddings of a
  finite field into the commutant of the Galois image, conjugate only up
  to an automorphism of that field (Wedderburn–Malcev). Composing the
  residue map with that automorphism is exactly what `ι₀` absorbs. It is
  also why the two-dimensionality hypothesis `hV` cannot be dropped: see
  the FAITHFULNESS AUDIT in
  `nonempty_hilbertBlumenthalPoint_of_isTwistedHilbertBlumenthalModuli`,
  where dropping it makes the consumer FALSE. -/

/-- **The Frobenius characteristic polynomials of the Tate modules form
one `D`-rational compatible system** (sorry node — item 9 of the
Tate-module construction, and the deepest statement in the chain: Weil's
Riemann hypothesis for abelian varieties over finite fields together
with Faltings' theorem that the system is independent of the residue
characteristic; see Faltings, *Endlichkeitssätze für abelsche
Varietäten über Zahlkörpern*, Invent. Math. 73 (1983), and Taylor 2002
§2 for the Hilbert–Blumenthal normalization used here).

For an abelian scheme with real multiplication by `𝒪_D` and an
`F`-point `x` there is a family `P : w ↦ P_w ∈ D[T]` of polynomials with
coefficients in `D` ITSELF, such that for EVERY maximal ideal `I` of
`𝒪_D`, every `π` and every frame `φ` of `TatePt m x I π` by a rank-two
representation `τ` over a coefficient ring `O`, the characteristic
polynomial of Frobenius at `w` on `τ` agrees with `P_w` inside an
algebraic closure of `ℚ_q`, for all but finitely many `w`.

Four points are load-bearing in the way this is stated.

* The system `P` is quantified BEFORE `I`: one family of polynomials
  serves every residue characteristic. That is exactly the
  independence-of-`λ` statement, and it is what makes the `λ`-adic and
  `𝔭`-adic Tate modules of a single abelian variety two members of ONE
  compatible system — the fields `matchℓ` and `matchp` of
  `HilbertBlumenthalPoint`.
* The exceptional set `bad` is quantified AFTER `q`, and this is not
  slack — the statement would be FALSE the other way round. `bad` must
  contain the places of `F` above `q`, where the `I`-adic representation
  is ramified and its Frobenius characteristic polynomial is not the
  Weil polynomial at all; and since `q` ranges over every rational
  prime, no single finite set can contain the places above all of them.
  Only the places of bad reduction of `A_x` are independent of `q`. The
  consumer needs no more: it applies this leaf at exactly two ideals and
  takes the union of the two exceptional sets, which is finite.
* `τ` is not quantified freely: it must FRAME the Tate module
  `TatePt m x I π`. Without that hypothesis the statement would be false,
  since nothing would tie `τ` to `A` — a residual condition constrains a
  representation only modulo `I`. The frame is transported along a
  bijection, and characteristic polynomials are invariant under
  conjugation, so no compatibility beyond additivity and Galois
  equivariance is required of `φ`.
* The embeddings `ψ` of `D` and `ι` of `O` into `ℚ̄_q` are likewise
  produced per `I` (they are the place of `D` over `q` determined by
  `I`, and the structural embedding of the completion), whereas `P` is
  not; `ι` is required injective, which is the statement that `O` is a
  domain of characteristic zero — the Carayol normalization of the
  coefficients. -/
