# Cancellation for `LocallyOfFinitePresentation` (Stacks 02FV)

If `f ≫ g` is locally of finite presentation and `g` is locally of finite
TYPE, then `f` is locally of finite presentation.

**HOISTED 2026-07-28, VERBATIM, out of `Fermat/FLT/Modularity/AbelianSchemeIsogeny.lean`**
(where it was proven 2026-07-26).  It is general scheme theory with no
abelian-variety content whatever, and `Fermat/FLT/FreyCurve/MazurTorsion.lean` —
which is NOT in `AbelianSchemeIsogeny`'s import cone, and cannot be — needs it to
reduce `etale_of_mono_of_relCurve` to miracle flatness.  The declaration keeps
its name and its `Fermat` namespace, so every existing consumer
(`AbelianSchemeIsogeny` itself and `Modularity/TateModule.lean`) resolves
unchanged through the `public import`.

The `etale_of_mono_of_relCurve` docstring in `MazurTorsion.lean` recorded this
lemma as "ABSENT from the pin", and named it as the reason that leaf is stated
as `Etale` rather than the sharper `Flat`.  That was true of mathlib and FALSE
of this project; the note has been corrected in place.

/-- **Cancellation for `LocallyOfFinitePresentation`** (PROVEN 2026-07-26):
if `f ≫ g` is locally of finite presentation and `g` is locally of finite
TYPE, then `f` is locally of finite presentation.  Stacks 0562/01TS.

This is general scheme theory with no abelian-variety content, and it is a
gap in mathlib at this pin: `LocallyOfFiniteType` has
`locallyOfFiniteType_of_comp` and `LocallyQuasiFinite` has
`LocallyQuasiFinite.of_comp`, both via `HasRingHomProperty.of_comp`, but
`LocallyOfFinitePresentation` has neither — and it cannot use
`HasRingHomProperty.of_comp` as it stands, because that helper's
hypothesis `Q (g ∘ f) → Q g` admits no side condition, whereas the ring
statement `RingHom.FinitePresentation.of_comp_finiteType` genuinely needs
`f` of finite type.  (It must: `LocallyOfFinitePresentation` is not
cancellable outright.  A closed immersion `Spec (R/I) ⟶ Spec R` with `I`
not finitely generated is not locally of finite presentation, while its
composite with `Spec R ⟶ Spec (R/I)`'s base need not see that.)

So the proof re-runs `HasRingHomProperty.of_comp`'s four-step reduction —
affine target, affine middle, affine source, then the ring statement —
carrying the auxiliary hypothesis through each step.  `LocallyOfFiniteType`
is Zariski-local at source and target, which is exactly what makes the
extra hypothesis survive the restrictions. -/
