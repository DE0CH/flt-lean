# Smooth compactification of a smooth curve over a field

Every smooth curve over a field embeds as a **dense open subscheme of a smooth proper
curve**, and the complement is finite.  This is the classical statement behind the
equivalence "smooth projective curves over `k` ↔ function fields of transcendence degree
one over `k`" (Hartshorne I.6), and it is what makes `X_0(N)` exist as soon as `Y_0(N)`
does.

Nothing of this kind is in `Mathlib` at this pin: there is no `IsNormal` for schemes, no
`Scheme.dimension`, no projective closure, and no compactification statement anywhere.
What *is* available — and what this file is built on — is enough to reduce the theorem to
four genuinely separate classical inputs, with the entire glue proved:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.normalization`, the **relative normalization**
  (`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Normalization.lean`), with `toNormalization : Y ⟶ Y'` and
  `fromNormalization : Y' ⟶ P`, the latter always `IsIntegralHom` and the former always
  `IsDominant`;
* **Zariski's Main Theorem** (`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ZariskisMainTheorem.lean`), whose
  corollary `IsOpenImmersion f.toNormalization` for `f` quasi-finite, separated,
  quasi-compact and locally of finite type is exactly the statement that `Y` sits inside
  its relative normalization as an *open* subscheme.

## The construction

Given a smooth curve `strY : Y ⟶ Spec K`:

1. compactify `Y` as a *scheme*, ignoring smoothness — Nagata's compactification theorem
   produces a proper `strP : P ⟶ Spec K` and an open immersion `i : Y ⟶ P`
   (`exists_isOpenImmersion_isProper`, LEAF);
2. take `X := i.normalization`, the normalization of `P` in `Y`.  Then
   `j := i.toNormalization : Y ⟶ X` is an open immersion **by Zariski's Main Theorem**
   and dominant **by construction** — both free from `Mathlib`;
3. `i.fromNormalization : X ⟶ P` is integral, and it is *finite* because normalization is
   finite for schemes of finite type over a field (`isFinite_fromNormalization`, LEAF);
   finite ⟹ proper, so `X` is proper over `K`;
4. `X` is normal of dimension one over a perfect field, hence smooth
   (`smoothOfRelativeDimension_one_fromNormalization`, LEAF);
5. the complement of a dense open in an irreducible noetherian curve is finite
   (`finite_compl_range_toNormalization`, LEAF).

Steps 2 and the assembly are PROVEN here.  Steps 1, 3, 4, 5 are the four leaves; each is a
standard theorem, each is independent of the others, and none of them mentions modular
curves — they are dispatchable in isolation.

## Faithfulness

`IsSmoothCompactification` is deliberately a *bundle of properties of a given `(X, j)`*
rather than an existential, so that a consumer quantifying over all compactifications
(as `Fermat.IsCompactificationY0` and `Fermat.IsX0Compactification` do) states something
at least as strong as the one about a chosen model.  Uniqueness up to unique isomorphism
is true and classical but is **not** stated here, because nothing consumes it; adding it
would be free-floating.

`PerfectField K` is load-bearing in step 4 and only there.  Over an imperfect field the
normalization of a curve can be regular without being smooth, so the theorem as stated is
false without it; `ℚ` is perfect, which is all the modular application needs.

## Relation to `Modularity/KhareWintenberger.lean` — READ BEFORE PROVING ANY LEAF HERE

That module independently states the SAME construction as its LEAF A/B/C
(`exists_quasiFinite_toProper_of_isAffine_finiteType`,
`isFinite_fromNormalization_of_smooth_affine`, and the smoothness of the normalized
model), in the special case of an **affine** `C` over `Spec (ULift ℚ)`.  Those three are
exactly `exists_isOpenImmersion_isProper`, `isFinite_fromNormalization` and
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_one_fromNormalization` below, specialised.

Neither file can use the other today — `X0.lean` and `KhareWintenberger.lean` are
siblings, both importing only `Modularity/AbelianScheme.lean`, and neither imports the
other.  This module sits UPSTREAM of both, which is why it is in the shim tree rather than
in either consumer.  **The two sets should be unified here**, with the
`KhareWintenberger` leaves re-derived as corollaries; that is a follow-up for an owner of
that file, not something to do from this side (its leaves carry hypotheses tuned to its
own consumer).  Whoever proves a leaf here should say so on that file's copy, and vice
versa, so the same theorem is not proven twice.

/-- **`strX : X ⟶ S` together with `j : Y ⟶ X` is a smooth compactification of
`strY : Y ⟶ S`.**

`Y` sits inside `X` as a dense open subscheme with finite complement, and `X` is a smooth
proper curve over the base.  This is the interface `Fermat.IsCompactificationY0` and
`Fermat.IsX0Compactification` are instances of.

`isDominant` (density) and `finite_compl` are not redundant with each other: density says
the closure of `Y` is all of `X`, finiteness of the complement says `X ∖ Y` is a finite
set of closed points.  On an irreducible curve each follows from the other, but the
structure does not assume irreducibility, and both are what the cusp count downstream
consumes. -/

/-! ### The four leaves -/

/-- **Nagata's compactification theorem, for a quasi-compact separated finite-type scheme
over a field** (sorry leaf).

TRUE and classical: Nagata (1962), *Imbedding of an abstract variety in a complete
variety*; see also Conrad's *Deligne's notes on Nagata compactifications* and Stacks
project tag `0F41`.  Any separated finite-type morphism to a quasi-compact
quasi-separated base factors as an open immersion followed by a proper morphism.

Note what is NOT claimed: `P` is **not** asserted normal, smooth, or even reduced.  That
is the whole point of routing through the normalization afterwards — Nagata's `P` is an
arbitrary proper model, and steps 3–4 of the module docstring repair it.  Weakening the
conclusion this far is what makes the leaf a citation rather than a construction.

`QuasiCompact i` is part of the conclusion rather than derived: an open immersion need not
be quasi-compact in general, and every consumer here needs it (Zariski's Main Theorem
takes it as a hypothesis).  Nagata's construction does deliver it, since `Y` is
quasi-compact and `P` is noetherian.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin: there is no compactification statement of any kind in
`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry`, and no projective closure to build one from — `Proj` exists
only as `ProjectiveSpectrum` of a graded ring, with no closure-of-a-quasi-projective-scheme
API. -/

/-- **The normalization of a scheme of finite type over a field is finite over it**
(sorry leaf).

TRUE and classical: a domain of finite type over a field is a Nagata (universally
Japanese) ring, so its integral closure in any finite extension of its fraction field is a
finite module.  Stacks tag `0335` (`0BXQ` for the geometric form).  Here the extension is
trivial — `i` is an open immersion, so `Y` and `P` share a function field — and the
statement is the familiar "normalization of a variety is finite".

Stated as `IsFinite` rather than `LocallyOfFiniteType`: `IsIntegralHom i.fromNormalization`
is already a `Mathlib` instance, and
`IsFinite.iff_isIntegralHom_and_locallyOfFiniteType` shows the two formulations agree, but
`IsFinite` is what the consumer wants (it yields `IsProper` immediately).

Note this is the ONLY place excellence/Nagata-ness of the base enters, and it is why the
theorem is stated over a field rather than over an arbitrary base scheme: over a general
noetherian base the normalization need not be finite (Nagata's counterexample).

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin: `Mathlib` has `IsIntegralClosure` finiteness for the classical
Dedekind-domain setting (`IsIntegralClosure.finite`, requiring separability or a Krull
domain) but no Nagata/Japanese-ring theory and no finiteness of normalization for a
finite-type algebra over a field.

Note `strP` is an EXPLICIT argument even though the conclusion does not mention it: it is
the finite-type structure on `P` that makes normalization finite, and leaving it implicit
would leave it undetermined at every use site. -/

/-- **The normalization of a curve over a perfect field is a smooth curve** (sorry leaf).

TRUE and classical, in three steps: the relative normalization `X` of `P` in the integral
scheme `Y` is normal and integral, and has the same function field as `Y`, hence the same
dimension `1`; a noetherian normal local domain of dimension one is a discrete valuation
ring, so `X` is regular (Serre's criterion in dimension one, or just
`IsIntegrallyClosed` + noetherian + dimension one ⟹ `IsDedekindDomain`); and over a
**perfect** field regular is equivalent to smooth (Stacks `056S`), the relative dimension
being `1` because `X` is a curve.

`PerfectField K` is load-bearing and the statement is FALSE without it: over an imperfect
field `k` of characteristic `p` the curve `y^p = t x^p + t` (`t ∈ k ∖ k^p`) is regular but
not smooth, and it is its own normalization.  `ℚ` is perfect, so the modular application
is unaffected.

`hY` — that `Y` itself is a smooth curve — is what pins the dimension to `1`; without it
the same construction applies in every dimension and the relative dimension in the
conclusion is unconstrained.  Note that smoothness of `Y` is used ONLY through its
dimension: the normalization forgets everything else about `Y`, which is exactly why the
same leaf serves a merely *normal* `Y`.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin, and it is the deepest of the four: `Mathlib` has no notion of a
normal scheme, no dimension theory for schemes beyond `coheight`, and no
regular-implies-smooth-over-a-perfect-field statement. -/

/-- **The complement of a curve in its compactification is finite** (sorry leaf).

TRUE: `i.toNormalization` is a dominant open immersion into the integral scheme
`i.normalization`, so its complement is a proper closed subset of an irreducible
noetherian space of dimension one, hence a finite set of closed points.

This is the one leaf that is purely topological — it needs no normality and no perfect
field, only "a proper closed subset of an irreducible noetherian one-dimensional space is
finite".  It is stated separately for that reason: it is by a wide margin the cheapest of
the four and the natural first dispatch.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin only for want of dimension theory: `coheight` exists
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Properties.lean`) but there is no statement that a scheme of
finite type over a field has finitely many points of any given coheight. -/

/-! ### The theorem -/

/-- **Every smooth curve over a perfect field has a smooth compactification** (PROVEN over
the four leaves above).

The construction is the one in the module docstring: compactify as a scheme (Nagata),
then normalize.  What `Mathlib` supplies for free, and what makes this assembly short, is
that both of the properties relating `Y` to `X` — openness of the immersion and density of
the image — are already theorems about the relative normalization:
`IsOpenImmersion i.toNormalization` is Zariski's Main Theorem, and
`IsDominant i.toNormalization` holds by construction.  Everything else is the properness
and smoothness of `X`, which are the leaves.

`IsIntegral Y` (irreducible and reduced) is required and is not a weakening: without
irreducibility the relative normalization is still defined but `IsIntegral i.normalization`
fails, and the finiteness of the complement is false for a disconnected `Y` with an
infinite component structure.  A geometrically connected smooth curve over a field is
integral, so the hypothesis is met in the intended application. -/

/-- **A compactification of a geometrically connected curve is geometrically connected**
(sorry leaf).

TRUE, and it is the one clause of the modular interface that the construction above does
not deliver directly.  The argument is short and purely topological once base change is in
place: `Spec K̄ ⟶ Spec K` is flat, so `Y_K̄ ⟶ X_K̄` is again a dominant open immersion; a
dense subspace of a space is connected only together with the whole space, i.e. the
closure of a connected subspace is connected, and the closure of `Y_K̄` is `X_K̄`.

Stated as a separate leaf rather than folded into `IsSmoothCompactification` because it is
a hypothesis-carrying implication, not a property of `(X, j)` alone: a compactification of
a DISCONNECTED curve is of course disconnected, and `Fermat.IsCompactificationY0` — which
is used at the degenerate level `N = 0`, where the curve is empty — deliberately does not
ask for it.  Only `Fermat.IsX0Compactification`, which is restricted to `N ≥ 1`, does.

IRREDUCIBLE at this pin only for want of the density-of-base-change step; `Mathlib` has
`GeometricallyConnected` and `IsDominant`, but no lemma transporting density along a base
change, and no `IsPreconnected.closure` phrased for schemes. -/
