# The projective Weierstrass model as an elliptic scheme over `Spec ℚ`

This module assembles `Fermat.exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`
(`Fermat/FLT/ModularCurve/X0.lean`) out of the pieces that had to land
first, and it exists as a SEPARATE module for one specific reason, given
under "Why this is not in `X0.lean`" below.

## Main definitions and results

* `Fermat.ProjGroupLaw` — morphism-level group-law data on the projective
  Weierstrass model, in exactly the shape
  `AbelianSchemeStruct.ofMorphisms` consumes.
* `Fermat.ProjGroupLaw.toAbelianSchemeStruct` — the bridge to
  `AbelianSchemeStruct` (PROVEN, formal).
* `Fermat.exists_ellipticScheme_of_projModel` — the assembled statement,
  which `X0.lean` transports verbatim onto
  `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`.

The open leaves are `nonempty_projGroupLaw`, `isProper_projToSpec`,
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec`,
`geometricallyConnected_projToSpec` and
`exists_projGeomFibreAddEquiv`; each carries its own docstring saying what
is missing and where the classical argument is.

## Why this is not in `X0.lean`

**A global token collision, and it is not a stylistic choice.**
`ProjectiveModel` reaches
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Projective/Basic.lean` and through
it `Mathlib/Tactic/Ring/NamePolyVars.lean`, which declares the command
syntax `name_poly_vars … " over " …`.  **Lean's token table is global**: an
atom reserved by any transitively imported module becomes a keyword,
whether or not the notation is ever opened.  So the bare identifier `over`
stops parsing in every module that transitively imports `ProjectiveModel`.

That is not hypothetical.  `X0.lean` declares
`IsCompactificationY0.over`, and `X0.lean` is `public import`ed by
`MazurTorsion.lean`, whose own dependent cone includes `ModThree.lean`,
`HermiteMinkowski.lean`, `Mazur.lean`, `InertiaCardTransport.lean` and
`CompletionInvariance.lean` — and `ModThree.lean` uses mathlib's
`Ideal.LiesOver.over`.  A `public import` of `ProjectiveModel` into
`X0.lean` therefore breaks files several modules downstream, with the error
reported at their `over` occurrence rather than at the import.

Keeping the `ProjectiveModel` dependency HERE, and having `X0.lean` take a
NON-public `import` of this module, confines the reserved token to
`X0.lean` itself (where the single affected field is written `«over»`,
which preserves the declaration name exactly) instead of propagating it
through the whole `MazurTorsion` cone.

The statement of `exists_ellipticScheme_of_projModel` is existential over
the scheme, so it mentions neither `proj` nor `projToSpec`; that is what
makes a proof-body-only use in `X0.lean`, and hence the non-public import,
sufficient.

`Hom_Sch(X, Spec R) ≃ Hom_Ring(R, Γ(X, ⊤))` (the `Γ ⊣ Spec` adjunction,
here through `AlgebraicGeometry.ext_to_Spec`), and `ℚ →+* A` is a
subsingleton (`Rat.subsingleton_ringHom`: `ℤ → ℚ` is a ring epimorphism, so
a ring map out of `ℚ` is forced — `n ↦ n · 1` and `1/n ↦ (n · 1)⁻¹`).

**Consequence for this file, and it removes three obligations.**  Every
"lies over the base" field of `ProjGroupLaw` — `hm`, `he`, `hi` — is an
equation between two morphisms whose TARGET is `Spec ℚ`, so all three hold
automatically and carry no geometric content whatsoever.  Over a general
base they are real conditions; over `Spec ℚ` they are not, because a
scheme admits at most one morphism to `Spec ℚ` and hence every morphism
between `ℚ`-schemes is automatically a `ℚ`-morphism.  This is what lets
`nonempty_projGroupLaw` below be reduced to the group axioms alone.

`X0.lean` records the same fact downstream as `subsingleton_hom_specQ`;
the two are deliberately differently named, because `X0.lean` imports this
module and a shared name would be a duplicate declaration there.  They
should be merged at integration, keeping this one (it is upstream). -/

/-- **Morphism-level group-law data on the projective Weierstrass model
of `E`**, in exactly the shape `AbelianSchemeStruct.ofMorphisms`
consumes: a group law on the fibre square, a unit section over the base,
an inversion, each compatible with the structure morphism, and the four
group axioms as EQUATIONS OF MORPHISMS.

This is why the node is writable at all.  `AbelianSchemeStruct.add` is an
operation on `RelPoint f g` for an ARBITRARY test scheme `T`, and there
is no functor-of-points description of `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` at this pin —
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` gives only
functoriality `Proj ℬ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` in the graded ring.  So `add` cannot be
written by hand on `T`-points.  Equations of morphisms can be, and
`ofMorphisms` derives the `T`-point presentation from them.

This structure carries no ellipticity hypothesis: it is data plus
equations, and it is satisfiable only for a genuine elliptic curve, which
is recorded in `nonempty_projGroupLaw` where the hypothesis belongs.  It
is deliberately NOT an interface to build against — `AbelianSchemeStruct`
is that interface, and `toAbelianSchemeStruct` is the one-line bridge. -/

Weierstrass model** (sorry node — what is left of items 5+6 once the
inversion `i` and the three structure-morphism compatibilities have been
discharged; see `nonempty_projGroupLaw` for the assembly).

TRUE and classical.  The addition FORMULAS are already at this pin over
an arbitrary `[CommRing R]` —
`WeierstrassCurve.Projective.addXYZ`/`addX`/`addY`/`addZ` in
`EllipticCurve/Projective/Formula.lean` — so nothing has to be invented;
what is missing is the *gluing*.  The formulas degenerate on the locus
where the naive chart fails, so `m` is obtained from the standard
three-chart cover of `A ×_ℚ A` together with agreement on the overlaps.
`e` is the point at infinity `[0 : 1 : 0]`, a section over `Spec ℚ`
because that point is rational.

`hassoc` (item 6) is the one axiom that is not a chart computation: as an
equation of morphisms out of `A ×_ℚ A ×_ℚ A` it is classically the
rigidity lemma, or the theorem of the cube, or — since `A ×_ℚ A ×_ℚ A` is
reduced and its generic fibre dense, `ℚ` having characteristic zero — a
reduction to equality of the two composites on `ℚ̄`-points, where it is
associativity of the classical group law of `E(ℚ̄)`.  That last route is
the cheapest here, and it is why ellipticity rather than mere smoothness
is hypothesised: `Δ ≠ 0` is what makes the generic fibre a smooth curve
and the reducedness argument valid.

`hcomm`, `hunit` and `hinv` are chart identities in the same formulas,
and are the easy half.

## What this leaf does NOT have to do any more, and why

Three obligations were removed from the original single leaf, and the
statement below is the residue.  **This is a strengthening, not a
weakening**: `hinv` is now demanded against the specific, named inversion
`projNeg E` rather than against an existentially quantified `i`, so a
witness for this leaf is strictly harder to produce than a witness for the
old one, and the old statement follows from it (see
`nonempty_projGroupLaw`).

* `i` is now **constructed**, as
  `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.projNeg E` — the substitution
  `Y ↦ −Y − a₁X − a₃Z` is a degree-preserving ring automorphism of
  `ℚ[X, Y, Z]` fixing the Weierstrass polynomial on the nose, so it
  descends to a graded automorphism of the homogeneous coordinate ring and
  `Proj` is a functor of that (`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.map`).  No gluing,
  no charts.  It is an involution: `projNeg_comp_projNeg`.
* `hm`, `he`, `hi` are **free over this base** (`hom_ext_spec_rat`): each
  is an equation between morphisms whose target is `Spec ℚ`, and a scheme
  has at most one morphism to `Spec ℚ`.

## ROUTE AUDIT (2026-07-27), stating the checks that would refute it

The `m`-half is gated on scheme-theoretic infrastructure that is genuinely
absent, and the axis searched was *how to write a morphism into a `Proj`*:

1. There is no functor-of-points description of `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` at this
   pin — `ProjectiveSpectrum/Functor.lean` gives only functoriality
   `Proj ℬ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` in the graded ring, which is exactly the route that
   *did* work for `projNeg` and does **not** work for `m` (the group law
   is not induced by a graded ring map, since its source is a product).
   *Refuting check*: grep `ProjectiveSpectrum/` for a `Proj`-valued
   universal property, or for `Scheme.OpenCover.glueMorphisms` applied to
   a `Proj` target.
2. So `m` has to be glued out of an open cover of `A ×_ℚ A`, and each
   piece is an affine morphism written from the `addXYZ` formulas.
   *Refuting check*: find a chart on which the naive formula is defined
   everywhere — there is none, which is precisely why `addXYZ` has
   branches.
3. `hassoc` additionally needs the density statement "two morphisms out
   of a reduced finite-type `ℚ`-scheme into `proj E` agreeing on
   `ℚ̄`-points are equal".  *Refuting check*: grep mathlib for a scheme
   morphism ext lemma over closed points of a Jacobson base.

The axis NOT searched: a rigidity/theorem-of-the-cube route that would
derive `hassoc` from `hcomm`, `hunit`, `hinv` and properness without
touching points.  That would be a genuinely different cut and it is where
the next owner should start if the gluing proves too expensive. -/

node).

Mathlib already has `IsProper (Proj.toSpecZero 𝒜)` under
`[Algebra.FiniteType (𝒜 0) A]` (`ProjectiveSpectrum/Proper.lean:368`), and
the homogeneous coordinate ring `ℚ[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W)` is visibly of finite
type over its degree-zero part.  What is NOT immediate is that this
transfers to `projToSpec`, which is `Proj.toSpecZero` FOLLOWED by
`Spec.map (algebraMap ℚ (projGrading E 0))`: properness is not stable
under postcomposition in general.  The missing input is that the second
map is an isomorphism, i.e. that the degree-zero part of the homogeneous
coordinate ring of the Weierstrass cubic is `ℚ` itself — provable at the
ring level, because the degree-`0` component of `ℚ[X, Y, Z]` is `ℚ` and
the homogeneous ideal `(W)` is generated in degree `3`, so it meets
degree `0` trivially. -/

/-- **The projective Weierstrass model is smooth of relative dimension
`1` over `Spec ℚ`** (sorry node — item 7a).

CORRECTION to the item-7 note in `exists_ellipticScheme_of_weierstrass`'s
docstring, and a sharpening rather than a restatement: the Jacobian
criterion is NOT absent from this pin.  `Mathlib/RingTheory/Smooth/Local.lean`
states it for LOCAL ALGEBRAS and `Smooth/StandardSmoothOfFree.lean` carries
`isUnit_jacobian_of_cotangentRestrict_bijective`.  What is missing is a
`Proj`-level formulation, so the task here is to DESCEND the local
criterion along the standard affine cover of `Proj` — `Proj.awayι` and
`Proj.affineOpenCover` — not to build a criterion from nothing.

On each affine chart the partial derivatives of the Weierstrass
polynomial generate the unit ideal exactly when `Δ` is invertible, which
is `E.IsElliptic`.  This is where ellipticity is genuinely used, and it
is the only place the discriminant enters. -/

`Spec ℚ`** (sorry node — item 7b).

The base change to `ℚ̄` is `Proj` of `ℚ̄[X, Y, Z] ⧸ (W)`, and `W` is an
irreducible cubic there — a reducible plane cubic is singular at an
intersection point of two components, contradicting
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_projToSpec` — so the coordinate ring is a
domain, and `Proj` of a graded domain is irreducible, hence connected.
Nonemptiness, which `GeometricallyConnected` demands through
`ConnectedSpace`, is the point at infinity. -/

Everything here is formal: `ofMorphisms` turns the data of `ProjGroupLaw`
into the functor-of-points presentation the moduli argument consumes, and
its two naturality fields cost the caller nothing.  `Smooth` is obtained
from `SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1` by `SmoothOfRelativeDimension.smooth`,
so smoothness is asserted once rather than twice. -/

/-! ### Compatibility of the morphism-level law with the `RelPoint` presentation

**This is the reusable payoff of stating the group law as morphisms.**
Every existing consumer in `X0.lean` and the moduli argument downstream is
written against `RelPoint`, not against `m`, `e`, `i`; so a producer that
hands over a `ProjGroupLaw` needs to know what the resulting `+`, `0` and
`-` on `RelPoint (projToSpec E) g` actually *are*.

All four lemmas below are definitional — `ofMorphisms` sets its `add`,
`zero` and `neg` fields to `addOfMor`, `zeroOfMor` and `negOfMor`, whose
values are `relPair x y ≫ m`, `g ≫ e` and `x.1 ≫ i` — but they are worth
stating, because after `toAbelianSchemeStruct` the underlying morphisms are
buried three definitions deep and no consumer should have to unfold
`ofMorphisms` by hand to reach them.  With these in place a `T`-point
computation on the projective model is a computation with `gl.m`, `gl.e`
and `gl.i` in the category of schemes, which is the only form in which the
chord–tangent formulas can be applied. -/

/-- **The geometric fibre of the projective Weierstrass model IS `E(ℚ̄)`,
equivariantly** (sorry node — item 8).

This is the conjunct that pins the scheme as *this* curve rather than
some elliptic curve: without it the node would be satisfiable by any
elliptic curve over `ℚ` whatsoever, and the bridge in `X0.lean` would
then manufacture a `Γ₀(N)`-datum out of the wrong curve.

Two halves, and only the first is missing.  The FIELD-level half is
already at this pin: `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.toAffineAddEquiv` gives
`W.Point ≃+ W.toAffine.Point` over a field.  What has to be supplied is
the identification of `Spec ℚ̄`-points of `proj E` with the projective
points `(E⁄ℚ̄).Point` — that a morphism `Spec ℚ̄ ⟶ Proj 𝒜` over `Spec ℚ` is
a homogeneous prime together with a `ℚ̄`-valued homogeneous coordinate.
For a `Proj` over a FIELD that is the classical description, and it does
NOT require the general `Hom(T, Proj 𝒜)` that is missing at this pin —
which is precisely why item 8 is a leaf rather than another instance of
the structural obstruction.

Galois equivariance is then automatic: `galSMul` is precomposition with
`Spec σ` (`AbelianSchemeStruct.galSMul_def`), and under the coordinate
description that is the coordinatewise action of `σ` on `[x : y : z]`,
which is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.map`.

Additivity is where the group law re-enters: the `≃+` must intertwine
`gl.m` with the chord–tangent law on `(E⁄ℚ̄).Point`, which on `ℚ̄`-points
is the defining property of the addition formulas.  So this leaf consumes
`ProjGroupLaw`'s DATA — hence the `gl` argument — but nothing of its
axioms beyond what `toAbelianSchemeStruct` already packages.

It is stated OUTSIDE the `open WeierstrassCurve.Projective` section
above: that namespace carries its own scoped `⁄` notation for
`baseChange`, which would make `E⁄(AlgebraicClosure ℚ)` ambiguous against
the `WeierstrassCurve.Affine` one this file opens at the top.  Hence the
qualified `projToSpec`. -/
